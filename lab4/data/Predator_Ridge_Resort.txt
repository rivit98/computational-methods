Predator Ridge Golf Resort is a 36-hole golf resort community in the Okanagan Valley outside Vernon, British Columbia. 
Predator Ridge Resort spans 1,200 acres and is home to a community of over 600 people.  The community was acquired by Wesbild Holdings Ltd  in 2007.
Opened in 1991, Predator Ridge hosted the British Columbia Open in 1993. The original two nine-hole loops, designed by Les Furber, were named after resident birds of prey: The Osprey and The Red Tail. A third nine-hole course was built in 2000, named The Peregrine.
