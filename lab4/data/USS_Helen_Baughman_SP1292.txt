She was commissioned as USS Helen Baughman (SP-1292).
Assigned to the 5th Naval District and based at Deale, Maryland, Helen Baughman served on patrol duties on the Chesapeake Bay for the rest of World War I, cruising Herring Bay, Tangier Sound, and surrounding areas.
The Navy returned Helen Baughman to the Conservation Commission on 27 November 1918.
