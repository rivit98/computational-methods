The Crossosomatales are an order, first recognized as such by APG II. They are flowering plants included within the Rosid eudicots.


== Description ==
Species assigned to the Crossosomatales have in common flowers that are positioned solitarily, with the base of the calyx, corolla, and stamens fused into a tube-shaped floral cup, sepals overlapping, the outermost smaller than the inner. Insides of the casings of pollen grains have horizontally extended thin regions (or endo-apertures). The gynoecium is placed on a short stalk, papillae on the stigma consist of two or more cells, ovary locules taper upwards, and the protective cell layer (or integument) surrounding the ovule leaves a zigzag opening (or micropyle). Some cell clusters have bundles of long yellow crystals, mucilage cells are present, and seeds have a smooth, woody coating.
