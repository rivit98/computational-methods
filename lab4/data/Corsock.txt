== Etymology ==
Corsock is a Cumbric name formed with the adjectival suffix -awg and either cors 'reeds, rushes, sedge' or crois 'cross'. If formed from cors it may have been an early name for the upper part of the Urr, meaning 'reedy place'. If formed from crois it would mean either 'place with a cross' or 'crossing place'.
