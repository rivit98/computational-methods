SCSM at Bangor University offers numerous degrees across a wide range of subjects including creative arts, film, journalism, media, new media, professional writing and theatre. All of the courses combine the practical and the theoretical, ensuring that students graduate with a comprehensive knowledge of their subject area. The staff include both highly regarded academics and creative practitioners. Staff expertise is matched by new state-of-the-art purpose built facilities.
SCSM facilities reflect the multidisciplinary nature of the school. As well as broadcast quality TV and Radio equipment, the School has dedicated spaces for those studying games and writing, as well as a theatre and digital cinema. All of these facilities are gathered together in the John Phillips hall – SCSM's home – situated on the shore of the Menai Straits.
Students from screenwriting, theatre and media practice courses often work together to produce practical pieces of work. |The course structure is flexible and allows students to choose modules from outside their specialised disciplines. SCSM also offers a degree in Creative Studies, which allows students to assemble an inter-disciplinary degree individually tailored to suit them.
