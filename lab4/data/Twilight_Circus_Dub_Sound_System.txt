Twilight Circus is the dub and reggae project of multi-instrumentalist Ryan Moore, former bassist and drummer of the Legendary Pink Dots. Twilight Circus is becoming increasingly popular and well known for Moore's work with artists such as Big Youth, Michael Rose of Black Uhuru and Ranking Joe. He originally started off producing dub albums, before recording vocalists for inclusion on his critically acclaimed Foundation Rockers album. In the classic tradition of reggae, Moore releases 10" vinyl record singles, often in limited edition.With Twilight Circus, Ryan Moore has worked with a wide range of respected figures from the dub, reggae and electronic genres including: Sly and Robbie, Dean Fraser, Luciano, Michael Rose (Black Uhuru) Big Youth,  Mikey General, Big Youth, Skully Simms, Vin Gordon (Bob Marley), Earl "Chinna" Smith (Bob Marley), Eddie 'Tan Tan' Thornton (Aswad), Buttons Tenyue /Matics Horns (UB40), Ansel Collins,  Style Scott (Dub Syndicate), Bobby Ellis ( Studio One), Admiral Tibet, Jah Stitch, Sugar Minott, Queen Ifrica, Lutan Fyah, Fred Locks, Gregory Isaacs, Mafia & Fluxy, Cevin Key ( Skinny Puppy), DJ Spooky,  and The Mad Professor.
Moore's fascination with dub began in the early 1980s, inspired by the nexus of punk rock and dub which film maker Don Letts forged in London, along with the futuristic possibilities hinted at by cyberpunk author William Gibson in Neuromancer. Throughout the 80's he obsessively collected every dub LP he could find, which included Jamaican dub from legends like King Tubby, Prince Jammy, Lee Perry and Scientist as well as 2nd-generation figures operating from London like Adrian Sherwood, Mad Professor, and Jah Shaka. Some of his early dub experiments from the mid-80's are to be heard on the ROIR release 'Twilight Circus - Dub From The Secret Vaults'.In 1994 Vancouver's Miller Block studio collective, owner / operator Darryl Neudorf handed Ryan Moore the keys to the studio for after hours sessions, where the first Twilight Circus album Ín Dub Vol.1 began to take shape. From 1994 to the present Moore has made recordings for Twilight Circus in Vancouver, London, Kingston-Jamaica, and The Netherlands - where he had his own studio.Since being the opening act for Skinny Puppy side project Download on their 1996 World tour and several tours billed with the Legendary Pink Dots, Twilight Circus has maintained a busy schedule playing all over the World on nearly every continent, including major festivals like Dour Festival, Summerjam, Fuji Rock Festival, One Love (UK), Asagiri Jam, Sierra Nevada World Music Festival, Vancouver Folk Music Festival.
