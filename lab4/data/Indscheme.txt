In algebraic geometry, an ind-scheme is a set-valued functor that can be written (represented) as a direct limit (i.e., inductive limit) of closed embedding of schemes.

          C
        
        
          P
          
            ∞
          
        
        =
        
          
            lim
            →
          
        
        ⁡
        
          C
        
        
          P
          
            N
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} P^{\infty }=\varinjlim \mathbb {C} P^{N}}
   is an ind-scheme.
Perhaps the most famous example of an ind-scheme is an infinite grassmannian (which is a quotient of the loop group of an algebraic group G.)
