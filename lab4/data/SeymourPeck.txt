Seymour Peck was forced to testify before the Senate when the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee subpoenaed him in Nov. 1955. The subpoena followed up testimony from journalist Winston Burdett in July of that year. Once on the stand Peck admitted his own involvement with the Communist Party from 1935–1949. When pressed by Senators Peck refused to answer questions about the affiliations of other people. He wouldn't name names. Peck a one-time staffer at the defunct Communist leaning New York Compass did not claim the protection of the 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution when he refused to answer the questions, he simply refused to answer.
