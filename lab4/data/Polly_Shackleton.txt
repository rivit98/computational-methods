Eleven years later in 1967, President Johnson appointed Shackleton to the first D.C. City Council. When the District held its first elected Council in 1974, Shackleton received one of the seats. After being elected to additional terms in 1978 and 1982, she retired from public office in 1986. During her tenure on the Council, Shackleton served on various committees dedicated to health and welfare, citizen's rights, and childcare. She was well known for her social efforts for the poor, children, elderly, and infirm. Shackleton also advocated for District Home Rule and National Representation. When it came to issues surrounding transportation, she supported METRO legislation and the building of bicycle paths. In addition, she was an active supporter of Project Pride, a D.C. summer program involving youth who built community while beautifying various parts of the city. Her efforts in office aided in the passing of 60 pieces of legislation that later became D.C. law.
