The 1898 Sheriff of London Charity Shield was the first edition of the Sheriff of London Charity Shield. The match and subsequent replay were both drawn and hence the honour was shared between Corinthian and Sheffield United.


== Match ==


=== Background ===

The contest was proposed by Sir Thomas Dewar who was a Sheriff of London in 1897 and part of the organising committee. Sheffield United F.C. were league champions for the first time in their history in the 1897â€“98 Football League and Corinthian were the premier amateur side of the time providing many of the England national football team players.


=== First-half ===
The first half was a very defensive encounter, partly due to the wet pitch. The referee Mr E.E. Stuart pulled up players from both sides for a large number of fouls.


=== Second-half ===
The second half saw more attacking play with strong showings from Corinthian's Smith and Burnup, however, the Sheffield backs Thickett and Cain were their match defensively.

== Replay ==


=== Background ===
The sides were largely unchanged with two changes for each to the initial lineups. Topham and W. L. Foster came in for Corinthian replacing Stanborough and Ingram. For Sheffield United, forwards Almond and Hedley replaced McKay and Gaudie.


=== First-half ===
Sheffield United scored first with a goal from their forward Almond following a pass from Cunningham.


=== Second-half ===
Fifteen minutes into the second half Corinthian's Topham was fouled near the goal mouth and a free kick resulted in a goal scored by W. L. Foster after a retake for encroachment. The game was again a strong defensive showing from both sides and at the end of 90 minutes Sheffield United refused to play extra time resulting in the honour being shared.
