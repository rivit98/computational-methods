== Biography ==
Barclay Macbride Crenshaw was born in Cleveland, Ohio and lived there until he was in seventh grade. His family then moved to Detroit. Having his own radio show in high school, Crenshaw had an interest in hip-hop music at first, but then embraced electronic music. Later he moved to Los Angeles, where he worked on numerous movie productions as location scout and production assistant. From 2002 to 2003 he worked on the documentary Intellect: Techno House Progressive, for which he interviewed more than 50 well-known DJs.In the early 2000s, Claude met up with "The Martin Brothers," Justin Martin and Christian Martin. In January 2005 he formed the Dirtybird Records label with a co-founder, Justin Martin. His wife, Aundy, funded the original start of the Dirtybird label under the holding Company Crenshaw Creative, of which Aundy is the chief operating officer and chief marketing officer. She gave him one year to turn it into a successful record label and would have cut him off if the label did not succeed. The Fabric imprint invited Barclay early in his DJ career to do a mix, and he accepted saying, "Fabric called me, and of course I agreed without hesitation. I have wanted to mix one of the Fabric series since I started DJing house. I feel like it is a nice achievement for a DJ, something that says, 'OK, this person is legit.'"
