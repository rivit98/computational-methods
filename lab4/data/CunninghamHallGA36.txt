The Cunningham-Hall GA-36 was an American two-seat monoplane 
modified from the GA-21M for the Guggenheim Safe Aircraft Competition.


== Design and development ==
The GA-21M was a two-seat low-wing monoplane designed and built in 1934 powered by a 145 hp (108 kW) Warner Super Scarab radial piston engine. An all-metal aircraft, it had a fixed conventional landing gear with a tailwheel. In 1935 the aircraft was rebuilt as the GA-36, first flying on 2 January 1936.  Part of the rebuild was a change from side-by-side to tandem seating and modified landing gear.No further aircraft were built and failing to find a buyer it was sold in 1941, (advertised for $2,950), stripped of major components and dumped until the 1980s, when it was recovered, fully restored and put on display at the Niagara Aerospace Museum.
