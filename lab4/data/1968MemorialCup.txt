The 1968 Memorial Cup  was the 50th annual Memorial Cup competition, organized by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) to determine the champion of junior A ice hockey. The George Richardson Memorial Trophy champions Niagara Falls Flyers of the Ontario Hockey Association in Eastern Canada competed against the Abbott Cup champions Estevan Bruins of the Western Canada Junior Hockey League in Western Canada. In a best-of-seven series, held at the Niagara Falls Memorial Arena in Niagara Falls, Ontario and at the Montreal Forum in Montreal, Quebec, Niagara Falls won their 2nd Memorial Cup, defeating Estevan 4 games to 1.
CAHA vice-president Lloyd Pollock oversaw the schedule, and used the Montreal Forum to increase profits for CAHA, since Maple Leaf Gardens was not available and due to the smaller size of the Niagara Falls Memorial Arena.
