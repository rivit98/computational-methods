The Ford LCF (Low Cab Forward) is a medium-duty cabover truck that was marketed by Ford Motor Company from 2006 to 2009.  Produced in a joint venture with Navistar International, (known as Blue Diamond, a nod to the Ford "Blue" Oval and the Navistar "Diamond") the LCF (and its International CF/CityStar counterpart) were manufactured in the same facility in General Escobedo, Mexico that produced the Ford F-650/750 Super Duty conventionals.
The first cab-over vehicle sold by Ford since the sale of the US rights to the Ford Cargo design to Freightliner in 1996, they competed primarily against the Isuzu NPR and its rebadged Chevrolet/GMC variants (along with the Mitsubishi Fuso FE).  Sold in various wheelbases, it has been used in various configurations, including dump trucks, fire trucks, tow trucks, box trucks, crane/bucket trucks, flat beds and stake bodies.


== Design ==


=== Chassis ===
The chassis was mostly based on existing F-Series architecture. The cab was derived from the Japanese Mazda Titan introduced in 2000.  Standard features included manual windows and steel wheels and a painted grille; for an extra cost, power windows could be added alongside a chrome grille, bumper, and wheels.  Styled similar to the Super Duty trucks, the grille of the LCF differed from its International counterpart, which featured vertical bars.


=== Powertrain ===
The LCF and CF were fitted with a single powertrain: a 4.5L V6 version of the 6.0L PowerStroke/VT365.  While the engine itself was exclusive to the two trucks, it was mated to the 5-speed Torqshift (5R110W) transmission shared with the Super Duty pickup line.


== Reception ==
It was widely criticized for its noisy engine, fuel consumption, lack of head and foot room (due to the placement of the steering column), and a dealer network who were uneducated on the product. The trucks many times sat, unsold, for several years.  Production came to an end along with the Ford-Navistar relationship, and Ford divested itself of Blue Diamond.
