The Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations (Swedish: Sveriges Akademikers Centralorganisation, SACO) is a confederation of 26 independent professional associations in Sweden. It gathers some 556,000 members, all of whom are academics or graduate professionals with a university or college degree. The members include economists, lawyers, architects, graduate engineers, doctors, scientists, teachers and many others. A growing share of Swedish union members are affiliated to a Saco union: 1% in 1950 and 18% in 2018 (pensioners and students excluded). The organisation does not form affiliations with political parties.
