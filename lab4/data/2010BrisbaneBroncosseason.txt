The 2010 Brisbane Broncos season was the 23rd in the club's history, and they competed in the NRL's 2010 Telstra Premiership. Before the start of the season, Brisbane's test centre Justin Hodges damaged an Achilles tendon at training, ruling him out for the entire year. Halfway through the season, the Broncos' other superstar centre Israel Folau announced that he was quitting rugby league at the end of the year to take up Australian rules football with AFL expansion club, Greater Western Sydney. With captain Darren Lockyer missing the last few games of the season due to a rib injury, Brisbane finished the regular season 10th (out of 16), failing to make the finals for the first time since 1991. The Broncos had agreed to terms for another superstar centre, Greg Inglis, to join them for 2011 but he reneged on the deal in the post season.


== Season results ==
The Broncos opened the 2010 season with a nail-biting 30-24 win over Queensland arch-rivals North Queensland Cowboys at Suncorp Stadium. Also for the second year in a row, Israel Folau was the first to score for the season for the Broncos. The Broncos suffered their worst ever loss at home against the New Zealand Warriors with a 48-16 loss at Suncorp Stadium in round 3. In round 9, the Broncos won their first game in Melbourne since 2003 with a 36-14 win over the Melbourne Storm at the newly opened AAMI Park. In round 10, the Broncos celebrated Corey Parker's 200th game in style with a 28-6 win over the Gold Coast Titans at Suncorp Stadium. Brisbane then lost five of its last eight matches after the Origin period, but they did defeat the eventual premiers St. George Illawarra in Round 21.
For the first time since 1991, the Broncos missed the finals finishing 10th after the regular season, the lowest placing position for the Broncos in their 23-year history. For only the second time in Broncos history, they lost more games than they won in the regular season, finishing with an 11-13 win-loss record and equalling the 2007 win-loss record (11-13), both the worst in the Broncos' history.
The Broncos experienced an 11 per cent increase in ticketed memberships from 11,900 in 2009 to 13,239 in 2010.
Fullback Josh Hoffman was awarded the 2010 Paul Morgan Medal for the Broncos' player of the year.On 11 October Paul Cullen's replacement as CEO of the club was announced as Paul White, a former police officer, who would take up the position in January.
