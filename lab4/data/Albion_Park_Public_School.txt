Albion Park Public School is a government co-educational primary school located in Albion Park, a suburb of City of Shellharbour, New South Wales, Australia.


== History ==
For the first one hundred years of its history the school served a predominantly close knit rural community. The years 1980 to 2004 have seen a sustained increase in housing developments and a loss of many of the traditional dairy farms around the township. Community services such as the swimming pool, library, sports field, museum and the opening of the school during 1991 have made Albion Park an attractive place to retire as well as bring up a family. Consequently, many younger families have moved into the township, considerably increasing enrolments at Albion Park Public School.
