Kosovo Pomoravlje (Serbian: Косовско Поморавље / Kosovsko Pomoravlje, "Pomoravlje of Kosovo") or Anamorava (Albanian: Anamoravë), is a valley in Kosovo, in the southern part of the District of Gjilan surrounding the Binač Morava River. It stretches eastward to the Preševo Valley in southern Serbia. The mountains in this region, rising to an altitude of 1,000–1,200 metres (3,300–3,900 ft), border the Skopska Crna Gora region in neighboring Macedonia north of Skopje. Gjilan, Kosovska Kamenica, Novo Brdo and Vitina are municipalities located in the region. The region gave its name to Kosovo-Pomoravlje District. It is known for recording the lowest temperature in Kosovo: −32.5 °C (−26.5 °F), on 25 January 1963.

It is bordered by the Skopska Crna Gora mountains in the south and the Goljak in the north, and borders Kosovo field in the west. On the east, it borders the Morava Valley. The region's largest cities are Gjilan and Bujanovac.

The region is known as Kosovsko Pomoravlje (Косовско Поморавље, "Morava Valley of Kosovo") in Serbian and as Lugina e Anamoraves Binçes ("Valley of Binač Morava") in Albanian.
