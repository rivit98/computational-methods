The LXVI Reserve Corps was formed on 21 September 1942 in Wehrkreis IX. The initial purpose of the corps staff was to oversee and lead the reserve divisions of Oberbefehlshaber West (Army Group D). Its headquarters were initially deployed in the Clermont-Ferrand area. The initial corps commander during the formation of the LXVI Reserve Corps was Erich Marcks, but Marcks was soon succeeded by Baptist Knieß on 12 November 1942.The LXVI Reserve Corps oversaw the formation of the LXXVI Panzer Corps on 25 February 1943. On 7 July 1943, Knieß was succeeded as the corps commander by Wilhelm Wetzel. Wetzel was in turn succeeded by Walther Lucht on 20 December 1943.Having received a new military postal number in June 1943, the LXVI Reserve Corps was renamed LXVI Army Corps on 5 August 1944. Subsequently, the corps was used in combat on the Western Front, including in the Vosges, Eifel and Ardennes region. It was subsequently subordinate, in order, to the 19th Army in September 1944, the 7th Army between October and December 1944, the 6th Panzer Army in January 1945, the 5th Panzer Army between February and March 1945, and the 11th Army in December 1945.
