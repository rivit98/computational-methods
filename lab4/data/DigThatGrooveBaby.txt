Dig That Groove Baby is the first full-length album by the Punk band Toy Dolls, released in 1983. It is considered by many fans to be the best work by the band and contains future live staples such as "Nellie the Elephant" and "Firey Jack". The song "Dig That Groove Baby" is included in the 2002 video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4.


== Recording ==

The album was recorded in February 1983 at Guardian Studios, which were located in a terraced house in the village of Pity Me in County Durham. The album only took three days to record and mix, which left no time to fix any mistakes. The rushed production also meant that Happy Bob recorded his drum parts while on a lunch break from a local hospital that he worked at.


== Songs ==
Algar said "My favourite songs on it are "Dougy Giro" (it's written from the heart and its' completely true; we knew Dougy well,) and also "Glenda and the Test Tube Baby" (I really love the chorus, it has minor chords which I like a lot, and it's one of our best)"


== Reception ==
In his 2004 book Burning Britain: The History of UK Punk 1980–1984, music journalist Ian Glasper called the album "brilliant" and said it "set the madcap tone that the Toy Dolls would become well loved for." Algar said that "I actually think the album has aged very well, and it's always sounded fresh–unlike some of the garbage we have written. It's the most special album for me anyway, because it was our first, but it's also one of the best."
