The 2017 BYU Cougars women's soccer team represented BYU during the 2017 NCAA Division I women's soccer season. The Cougars were coached for a 23rd consecutive season by Jennifer Rockwood, who was co-coach in 1995 and became the solo head coach in 1996. Before 1995 BYU women's soccer competed as a club team and not as a member of the NCAA. The Cougars entered the 2017 season having won five consecutive West Coast Conference championships and having made the NCAA Tournament each of the last five seasons and in 18 of the 22 seasons that Rockwood has been the head coach. Joining Rockwood as assistant coaches are Brent Anderson (1st season) and Aleisha Rose (14th season) with volunteer assistants Rachel Jorgensen (4th season) and McKinzie Young (6th season). The Cougars came off of a season were they advanced to the third round of the College Cup before being defeated by South Carolina to finish the season 18–3–1. The Cougars were picked to finish second by the WCC media. After a slow start the Cougars finished the season with their first losing record since 2004 at 7–8–4 and failed to make the NCAA Playoffs for the first time since 2011. They finished the conference tied for fourth at 4–4–1.
