Landsborough railway station is located on the North Coast line in Queensland, Australia. It serves the town of Landsborough in the Sunshine Coast Region.


== History ==

In 1998, construction began on Platform 2.In December 2006, the State Government announced the station would be upgraded. The work was completed in late 2007, and included the building of new platforms, rainwater tanks, shelters, lighting, and toilets. A new cark park was also built. These upgrades were part of an overhaul of the Caboolture to  Landsborough section of the North Coast line. The section was to be duplicated in full by 2012, but so far only the Caboolture to Beerburrum section has been completed. This is now scheduled to be completed by 2021.On the eastern side of the station, a locomotive turning triangle remains in use, making Landsborough a popular destination for steam trains from Brisbane.The station has the Landsborough Air Raid Shelter, one of the few remaining examples of World War II reinforced-concrete air raid shelters in Queensland. Landsborough was a regular stopping point for refreshments for troop trains. The air raid shelter is now heritage-listed.
