Philip Hussey (died 1783), portrait-painter, born at Cork.Hussey was born at Cloyne, in the county of Cork and his career began as a sailor. He was shipwrecked three times. He drew the figureheads and stern ornaments of vessels, and eventually set up in Dublin as a portrait-painter under the patronage of Lord Chancellor Bowes, painting full-length portraits with some success. He was a good musician, and was skilled as a botanist and florist. His portraits of women are said to be those of men. Although a notable Irish portrait painter, Hussey is not thought to be amongst the most important. His house was a meeting place of many leading men of art and letters in Dublin. He died at an advanced age in 1783 at his house in Earl Street, Dublin.
