== Chapter 10 of The Walk West, A Walk Across America 2 ==
The book The Walk West, A Walk Across America 2  by Peter Jenkins and Barbara Jenkins tells the second part of the story of the authors' walking trip across the United States. In the 10th chapter, the hikers are traveling through Louisiana and stay for a few days with Wally Hebert and his wife Bobbie. Peter and Barbara Jenkins were friends with Wally Hebert, Jr. in New Orleans, and the younger Hebert suggested at the time that if they were ever passing through the town of Westlake, that they could find a place to stay with Preacher and Bobbie. The 10th chapter is entitled "Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, and Preacher Hebert." In it, Hebert relates his experiences in major and minor league baseball, tells about his life growing up in the Louisiana swamps and bayous, discusses his football experiences, and gives a glimpse into his post baseball life as a farmer and as a fisher of the Louisiana waterways.


== The nickname ==
Hebert got the nickname "Preacher" in first grade when he wore a hat to school that his classmates thought was a preacher's hat. However, The Walk West, A Walk Across America 2 states otherwise. Hebert claims that he got his nickname from baseball, and remarks that his first nickname was "Mississippi Mudcat." However, as another player had that moniker, his teammates then changed the nickname to "Preacher" and he never could figure out why they chose it.
