Bean Pole, established in 1989, is a South Korean fashion brand owned by Samsung’s Cheil Industries. It produces ‘neo traditional’ family fashion (Bean Pole Men, Bean Pole Ladies, and Bean Pole Kids); as well as accessories (Bean Pole Accessory), golf wear (Bean Pole Golf), and outdoors fashion/equipment (Bean Pole Outdoor). Towards the end of 2012 they added the ‘Bike Repair Shop’ to their list of sub-brands.


== Background ==
Since 1989, Bean Pole’s fusion of traditional and contemporary British fashion culture has led it to become a top brand in South Korea; with three design departments located in: Korea, the United States of America, and Italy. In the past decade, they have gradually expanded internationally, with the majority of its shops located in Asia. In addition, all of their flagship shops are located in South Korea: Myeongdong, Gangnam, Doonsan, DongSeongRo, GwangBok; and the bike repair shop in Hongdae.


=== Logo ===

Since its establishment, BeanPole has adjusted its logo, making minor changes since the original. The logo is a depiction of a man riding a penny-farthing bicycle, which represents the brand’s image: “a dedication to rise to new challenges and pursue creativity.” Furthermore, the logo is to emphasize the British-like style that they aim for.
