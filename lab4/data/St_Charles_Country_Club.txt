St. Charles Country Club is a private country club in Winnipeg, Manitoba. It features three nine-hole golf courses, each with a distinct style that reflects the golf course designer responsible for it.


== History ==
The original 18-hole course was opened in 1904, but three legendary golf course designers are responsible for the current 27 holes.  In 1919, Donald Ross rebuilt the course and created the two nines that now comprise the South and West nines.  Alister MacKenzie was then hired to create an additional nine holes and designed the North nine, which opened in 1931.  In 1954, Canada's Norman Woods was responsible for the renovation and redesign of the West nine. The North, West and South Nines were renamed the MacKenzie, Woods and Ross nines, respectively, in honour of the designer responsible for each nine following the club's centennial celebrations in 2004.
The course has played host to LPGA, Senior PGA and Shell's Wonderful World of Golf events. The club hosted the 1952 Canadian Open, a PGA Tour tournament, which was won by Johnny Palmer, and the 1992 du Maurier Classic, an LPGA major, which was won by Sherri Steinhauer.
In August 2010, the club hosted the LPGA's Canadian Women's Open, won by Michelle Wie; the MacKenzie (North) nine was used as the front nine, and the Ross (South) nine was used as the back nine.
