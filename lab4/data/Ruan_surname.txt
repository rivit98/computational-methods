Ruan (Chinese: 阮; pinyin: Ruǎn; Wade–Giles: Juan, [ʐwàn] (listen)) is a Chinese surname.
The Taiwanese Hokkien version [uân] or [ŋ̩̂] is transcribed Oán and Ńg in Pe̍h-ōe-jī. The Cantonese version [jy̌n] is romanized Jyun2 in the Jyutping system or Yún in the Yale system, or more commonly Yuen or Un (the latter is typical in Macau). In Hokchew Chinese, it is Nguang.
Its Vietnamese equivalent is Nguyễn (pronounced [ŋʷǐˀən] (listen) in Northern Vietnamese and [ŋʷĩəŋ] (listen) in Southern Vietnamese), and is the most common Vietnamese family name.
