The Barossa Range (Kaurna: Yampoori) is a mountain range located in the Australian state of South Australia. 


== Location ==
The range is a part of the southern Mount Lofty Ranges and the western slopes primarily fall into the Barossa Valley. As such, the range is the main source for the North Para River and its tributary Jacob's Creek. The highest point of the range is Mount Kaiser Stuhl with an elevation of 588 metres (1,929 ft) AHDâ€‰ and forms part of the Kaiserstuhl Conservation Park. Mengler Hill, another notable peak within the range, lies on the road route from Tanunda to Angaston.


== Naming ==
The range was named by Colonel William Light in 1837 after Barrosa Hill (Cerro de Puerco) in the modern municipality of Chiclana de la Frontera, Spain, to which it he thought it similar. The Spanish location was the site of the Battle of Barrosa and was won by Light's friend Lord Lynedoch in 1811. The word barrosa in Spanish and Portuguese languages simply means "muddy".  Thus named, the Barossa Range was the source of many other local place names, such as the Hundred of Barossa and better-known Barossa Valley.


== Settled features ==
The Heysen Walking Trail and the Mawson Cycling Trail both traverse the range. 
It is also home to some of the many wineries in the region, including those in Eden Valley.
