59-16 Light Tank (simplified Chinese: 59-16式轻型坦克; traditional Chinese: 59-16式輕型坦克) was a former Chinese light tank design which was developed during the late 1950s, originally intended as one of the "tributes to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the PRC". Within the design plans, the intended weight was planned to be approximately 16 mt with a 76 mm tank gun. However, because this tank was too weak to fight against the western tanks at that time, it was eventually set aside by the military.
