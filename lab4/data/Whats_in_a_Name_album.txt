== Critical reception ==
Allmusic critic, Dave Thompson, wrote:
"[The album] captures the band at both its zaniest and, fortunately, its most musical . . . If the Howard/Blaikley songwriting team had yet to hit the stride that would propel Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich to the top of the charts in 1967, "You Make It Move" and "Hideaway" still possess a persistent timelessness that marked them out for greatness. Of course, the group's true masterpiece, Time to Take Off, was still a year away when What's in a Name was released. But nobody who paid close attention to this set could have been truly surprised at what would soon be accomplished.‚Äù
