== Plot ==
Frank Dayton (Leslie Nielsen) leads a group of crooks in a caper to steal $2,500,000 from an Air Force base. Dayton is the tough-guy military leader who recruits Mike (Rory Calhoun), ex-Nazi Max (Hans Gudegast), sadistic killer Barney Barry (Barry Sadler), and failed French artist Claude (Pat Renella) in the scheme. Singer Lainie Kazan plays the romantic interest for Dayton as the nightclub songbird Leda.
Actor Hans Gudegast, known at the time from TV war series "The Rat Patrol," later changed his name to Eric Braeden, becoming a soap opera star in "The Young and the Restless."  Barry Sadler, as Sgt. Barry Sadler, had a top 40 hit record with "Ballad of the Green Berets."
