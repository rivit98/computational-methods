== Track notes ==


=== "Die Firma" ===
The typical leading song of an Onkelz album: A self-praising anthem for the band and their fans.


=== "Narben" ===
A song of scars and the way they remind its owner of old times. "A book written in skin"


=== "Macht für den der sie nicht will" ===
Song against lying politicians, who are only interested in political power.  "On the front for the nazis, they were informers of the Stasi, and today they say there's democracy".


=== "Mutier mit mir" ===
A song to make a change in life and start over new. "This is the time to be reborn"


=== "Keine Amnestie für MTV" ===
The Böhse Onkelz and MTV stood in contact several times, MTV wanted to make an MTV Masters about this band. The Persian reporter became acquainted with the whole history of the Onkelz. Two days before MTV sent the Masters, they suspended the reporter and cut the whole Masters in a "public-suited" format, which means that none of the reproaches against the Onkelz could be cleared up.


=== "Wie kann das sein" ===
A song against the sex-tourism to Southeast-Asia, especially against those who abuse children.


=== "Nr. 1" ===
Against Klaus Walter, a German journalist known for his critical attitude against the band.


=== "Stand der Dinge" ===
A song about the melancholy of life without change and the will to escape from it.


=== "Ich weiß wo Du wohnst" ===
A song about stalking.
