Arvid Mörne (6 May 1876 – 15 June 1946) was a Finnish author and poet.
He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times.


== Life ==
Mörne was born in Kuopio. He obtained a master's degree in literature and history at the University of Helsinki in 1897, and a PhD in 1910. He worked as a superintendent at the Nyland's folk high school Finns between 1899–1909, and as a teacher at the same school between 1909-11. He was forced to leave this position after his involvement in the General Strike of 1905.
He became a docent of domestic literature at the University of Helsinki in 1913, a position he held until 1943. He worked at the newspapers Nyländska posten (1900–1902) and Veckans Nyheter (1902–1904) and also at Arbetaren and Helsingforsposten. He was also a literature critic for the newspapers Dagens Press and Svenska Pressen.
His socialistic viewpoints would be reflected in his poetry, but he also felt strong for the weakest and for the Finnish archipelago nature. He also wrote the lyrics for the popular Swedish song "Båklandets vackra Maja" (with music composed by Hanna Hagbom).
He was married to the actress Signe Hagelstam and had three children. His works would eventually become more popular after his death in Kauniainen in 1946, and today he is considered one of the prime Finnish poets of the 20th century.The Arvid Mörne competition in literature is named after him and given every year by Svenska Folkskolans Vänner.
