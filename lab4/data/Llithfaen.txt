Llithfaen is a small village on the Llŷn Peninsula in Gwynedd, Wales. It is located around 4 miles north-east of Nefyn and lies just south-west of Yr Eifl mountains, on the B4417 road from Llanaelhaearn to Nefyn. Formerly in the parish of, it is now in the community of Pistyll. It is in the historic county of Caernarfonshire.
Two businesses in the village are run by the community – the Tafarn Y Fic pub, and Siop Pen-y-Groes – the village shop.There used to be three quarries close to the village, the last of which (Chwarel Carreg y Llam) closed in 1963. The population grew at the opening of a granite quarry on Yr Eifl in the 19th century. Many houses were built and the census in 1881 shows many immigrants from other areas of the peninsula, Penmaenmawr and as far as Scotland. In the first half of the 19th century, before the opening of the granite quarries in Nant Gwrtheyrn, many smallholders supplemented their incomes by taking heather cut from the slopes of Tre'r Ceiri to be sold as kindling in Pwllheli for sixpence a bundle.As of 2002, musician Ian Brown had a holiday home in the village.
