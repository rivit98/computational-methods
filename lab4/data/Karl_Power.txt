Karl Power is a prankster from Droylsden, Manchester known for appearing uninvited at sporting events as an impostor. Most notoriously he appeared in the Manchester United team photo before a UEFA Champions League match against Bayern Munich in 2001.After the stunt, there was a nationwide manhunt in the United Kingdom for Power with tabloid newspapers asking their readers to write in and give them information.
