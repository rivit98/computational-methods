His first public performance as a bertsolari took place in Legorreta in 1936. He came first in a competition for young improvisational musicians in 1950. Twelve years later he entered the prestigious contest (txapelketa), reaching the finals. He ranked second in the same event three years later, coming up finalist again in 1967.He continued to perform regularly until January 1993, when he suffered a heart attack following a public performance which included a tribute to Aita Santiago Onaindia and Alfonso Irigoyen. He died in San Sebastián in April 1993 following three months in a coma.A bertsolari contest named after Lazkao Txiki, the Lazkao Txiki Bertsopaper Lehiaketa, was launched in 2007.
