=== Race One ===
Borković's Chevrolet sprung an oil leak on the grid after his engine change, with sand applied to his grid slot as a result. At the start the three Citroëns got away while Tarquini attacked Valente for fourth and Monteiro and Michelisz battles for sixth. Chilton did not get away at the start and the rest of the field went around the stranded Chevrolet before he got going. Valente went wide at La Source but got back as Tarquini dropped back towards Monteiro the midfield pack. Morbidelli passed the two factory Hondas and took fifth place. Huff spun out on the oil on the track at turn 12 and dropped to the back of the field. Both Valente and Mehdi Bennani were given drive–through penalties for exceeding track limits as López and Loeb battled for second place at the start of lap four which gave Muller a chance to distance himself from his title rivals. The windscreen on Ma's car broke on lap six as he battled for tenth position with Chilton and Borković, the screen had bent and distorted his vision. On the last lap López passed Loeb for second place at Les Combes while Monteiro was close up behind Morbidelli in pursuit of fourth place. Muller claimed a dominant win with López second and Loeb in third completing the Citroën 1–2–3, Monteiro made a last corner lunge on Morbidelli which allowed Tom Coronel to close in and take fifth place at the line.
