U.S. Route 400 (US 400) is a 481.306-mile-long (774.587 km) mostly eastâ€“west U.S. Highway, commissioned in 1994. The highway's western terminus is in Granada, Colorado, at an intersection with US 385. The highway's eastern terminus is southwest of Joplin, Missouri, near Loma Linda, at an interchange with Interstate 44, with which it shares with US 166. It originally ended in Garden City, Kansas; in 1996 it was extended to its current western terminus. Its route number is a "violation" of the usual AASHTO numbering scheme, as there is no "parent" US 0.


== Route description ==


=== Colorado ===
US 400 begins in Granada at an intersection with US 385. It then runs concurrently with US 50 through Holly east to the Kansas border.


=== Kansas ===

US-400 and US-50 enter Kansas west of Coolidge. They run concurrently through Garden City, where it intersects US-83 and separate at Dodge City, which is where it intersects US-56 and US-283. It continues southeast from Dodge City and first intersects US-54 at Mullinville.
US-400 and US-54 begin a long concurrency at Mullinville which passes through Greensburg, Pratt and Kingman before entering Wichita. While in Wichita, US-400 and US-54 intersect Interstate 235 and the concurrency of US-81 and Interstate 135. K-96 provides a short freeway connection to Interstate 35, which is also the Kansas Turnpike. At Augusta, US-400 and US-54 enter into another concurrency with US-77, and US-400 breaks from this concurrency at Haverhill.

US-400 continues east through several small towns before turning southeast to go through the Fredonia area and intersecting US-75 at Neodesha. After a brief concurrency with US-75, it turns east, first intersecting U.S. Route 169 near Morehead and then US-59 near Parsons before finally intersecting US-69 south of Pittsburg. It then turns south with US-69 and at Crestline, follows US-69A south to Riverton. US-400 then turns east with US-166 at Baxter Springs and the two highways run concurrently eastward into Missouri.


=== Missouri ===
US 400, along with US 166, terminates at I-44 about one mile (1.6 km) east of the Kansas-Missouri state line, three miles (5 km) west of Joplin.

=== U.S. Route 154 ===
A section of U.S. 400 that ran from Dodge City to Mullinville, Kansas was U.S. Route 154 from 1926 to 1982. It later became K-154 before becoming part of U.S. 400.
