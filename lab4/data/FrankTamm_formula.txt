The Frank–Tamm formula yields the amount of Cherenkov radiation emitted on a given frequency as a charged particle moves through a medium at superluminal velocity. It is named for Russian physicists Ilya Frank and Igor Tamm who developed the theory of the Cherenkov effect in 1937, for which they were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1958.
When a charged particle moves faster than the phase speed of light in a medium, electrons interacting  with the particle can emit coherent photons while conserving energy and momentum. This process can be viewed as a decay. See Cherenkov radiation and nonradiation condition for an explanation of this effect.

Cherenkov radiation does not have characteristic spectral peaks, as typical for fluorescence or emission spectra. The relative intensity of one frequency is approximately proportional to the frequency. That is, higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) are more intense in Cherenkov radiation. This is why visible Cherenkov radiation is observed to be brilliant blue. In fact, most Cherenkov radiation is in the ultraviolet spectrum; the sensitivity of the human eye peaks at green, and is very low in the violet portion of the spectrum.
The total amount of energy radiated per unit length is:

If 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   has a positive real part (usually true), the exponential will cause the expression to vanish rapidly at large distances, meaning all the energy is deposited near the path. However, this isn't true when 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
    is purely imaginary - this instead causes the exponential to become 1 and then is independent of 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  , meaning some of the energy escapes to infinity as radiation - this is Cherenkov radiation.

  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   is purely imaginary if 
  
    
      
        ϵ
        (
        ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \epsilon (\omega )}
   is real and

        )
        >
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta ^{2}\epsilon (\omega )>1}
  . That is, when 
  
    
      
        ϵ
        (
        ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \epsilon (\omega )}
   is real, Cherenkov radiation has the condition that 
  
    
      
        v
        >

                  (
                  ω

    {\displaystyle v>{\frac {c}{{\sqrt {\epsilon (\omega }})}}={\frac {c}{n}}}
  . This is the statement that the speed of the particle must be larger than the phase velocity of electromagnetic fields in the medium at frequency 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   in order to have Cherenkov radiation. With this purely imaginary 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   condition,

    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {\lambda ^{*}}{\lambda }}}=i}
