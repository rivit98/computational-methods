The Xiaomi Mi MIX Alpha is an Android-based smartphone manufactured by Xiaomi. Xiaomi describes it as a concept phone, but plans on bringing it into small-scale production. It was scheduled to be released in December 2019, but is now delayed.


== Design ==
A 7.92-inch (201.2mm) 2088 Ã— 2250 Super AMOLED display is used which wraps around the edges and nearly spans the entire width of both sides. There are virtual volume buttons in place of physical ones, although there is a physical power button on the top. Navigation buttons and the status bar are also located on the edges of the device. A sapphire vertical strip is placed on the rear which houses the cameras, flash and connectivity antennas. The frame is a titanium alloy, while the display will be a 3-section glass laminate.

=== Hardware ===
The Mi Mix Alpha is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ CPU and the Adreno 640 GPU, sharing its chipset with the Mi 9 Pro. It is only available in one variant with 12 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 512 GB of non-expandable UFS 3.0 storage. A USB-C port is located on the bottom which is capable of recharging the 4050mAh battery at up to 40W. An optical in-display fingerprint is used, and facial recognition is also supported.


==== Camera ====
A triple camera setup is used, consisting of a wide lens, a telephoto lens and an ultrawide lens like most flagships, while lacking a front-facing camera, however, the rear-facing cameras serve this purpose. Notably, it is the first smartphone with a 108 MP sensor. The other two lenses use 12 MP and 20 MP sensors respectively. None of the lenses have OIS, but HDR is supported. Along with normal recording modes, the device is capable of recording 8K video at 30 fps, 4K video at 60 fps and 30 fps, and 1080p slow-motion video at 480 and 960 fps.


=== Software ===
The Mi Mix Alpha runs on MIUI 11, which is based on Android 10.
