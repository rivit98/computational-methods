XHRV-FM (branded as Exa FM) is a Spanish & English Top 40 (CHR) radio station that serves the Valle Hermoso and Matamoros border area.


== History ==
XHRV's concession history begins in San Fernando, Tamaulipas. On November 23, 1994, Libertas received the concession for XHSAF-FM 100.9. XHSAF became XHRV-FM on April 27, 1998 (a later XHSAF-FM on the same frequency in the same town was awarded just months later for the Radio Tamaulipas state network).
In 2006, XHRV conducted a move into the RÃ­o Grande Valley by soliciting a move to Valle Hermoso.
