The competition was held on Wednesday, September 21, 1904 and on Thursday, September 22, 1904. It was the first time the event, like all other boxing events, was held in Olympic competition. Welterweights had to be less than 65.8 kilograms. Four boxers competed.

Since there was no bronze medal match, Egan and Lydon were both awarded bronze medals.
Jack Egan originally won the silver medal in the lightweight competition and the bronze medal in the welterweight competition. Later it was discovered that his real name was Frank Joseph Floyd while the AAU rules made it illegal to fight under an assumed name. In November 1905 the AAU disqualified Egan from all AAU competitions and he had to return all his prizes. In the lightweight competition Russell van Horn moved up to silver. However according to IOC's medal database for 1904 Olympics Jack Egan has silver medal in Boxing lightweight and bronze medal in Boxing welterweight, Russell van Horn has bronze in the lightweight competition and Joseph Lydon keeps bronze in the welterweight competition.
