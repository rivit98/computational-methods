== Creative career ==
Puett is a trans-disciplinary creative producer in the areas of installation art practices, clothing design, architecture, photography, and fine art.


=== Art practice ===
Her work uses conceptual tools including research-based methods in history, biology, new economies, design, craft and collaboration. Morgan's early work forged new territory by intervening into the fashion system with a series of storefront installations and clothing/dwelling/event projects in Manhattan, New York in the 1980s and 90s, then produced a long series of research installations on the histories of the needle trade systems in museums and festivals around the world. her practice has been innovative in that it has encouraged new forms of social engagement in art.


=== Fashion Work ===
Between 1985 and 1997, Puett was known for her "upscale depression era" fashion designs, sold through her New York boutique. When her final store closed in 1997, she held an exhibition of the leftover business items, such as cheques, business cards and unsold clothes, dipped in beeswax.


=== The RN Patch ===
In the early 2000s, the American Association of Nurses and the Center for Nurse Advocacy sought a means to better identify registered nurses in busy medical environments, in order to reduce confusion and help patients and others identify nurses quickly. In 2003, as part of the exhibition RN: The Past, Present, and Future of the Nurses' Uniform at The Fabric Workshop and Museum, Philadelphia. Pruett collaborated with Mark Dion to create a patch for registered nurses to wear on their uniforms. The patch, a simple square with the letters "RN", could be put on any scrubs and was considered a "simple, elegant solution".


=== Mildred’s Lane Project ===
With Mark Dion, she is a founder of The Mildred's Lane Project, an experimental artist's residency program. Karen Archey, writing in Art in America, described Mildred's Lane as an "ongoing experiment in pedagogy, a social space, a site for artistic and architectural intervention, a residency program, and home to Puett..." Located on a 96-acre farm in rural Berlin Township Pennsylvania, the residency focuses on social and political practice in the arts.
