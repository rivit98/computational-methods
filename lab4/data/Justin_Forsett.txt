Notre Dame's running backs coach at the time, Buzz Preston, later said that Notre Dame was looking for a taller running back.

Coach Jeff Tedford offered Forsett a scholarship after watching Forsett's game tape and receiving a tip from Cal great Chuck Muncie, and made Forsett one of the last signings of Cal's 2004 recruiting class.


== College career ==
With a deep depth chart at running back, it appeared Forsett would redshirt his freshman year, but an impressive performance in fall camp kept him on the active roster.  In the season opener, Forsett had 34 yards rushing and a touchdown in Cal's victory over Air Force.  Forsett played mostly as a backup during his first three years behind J.J. Arrington and Marshawn Lynch. Nevertheless, he managed to amass a good amount of playing time.  During his freshman year, Forsett was used primarily on special teams, returning one kickoff for 11 yards but usually blocking for Marshawn Lynch.  On coverage units, he made 3 tackles and blocked a punt in the endzone for a touchdown against Washington.During his sophomore year, Forsett became second on the Cal depth chart at running back.  He filled in when Lynch was injured in the early season and ran for 235 yards against New Mexico State, good for the fourth highest single game rushing effort in school history.  In Forsett's junior year, he continued his role as backup.  He ran for over 100-yards against Oregon when injuries sidelined Lynch and in Cal's rout of Texas A&M in the 2006 Holiday Bowl.

As a starter his senior year, Forsett rushed for 1,546 yards on 305 carries, and scored 15 touchdowns. He opened the season with 156 yards rushing and a touchdown against Tennessee.  His 15 touchdowns led all rushers in the Pac-10, and his 1,546 rushing yards finished second, behind Oregon tailback Jonathan Stewart. Forsett's efforts earned him a selection to the All-Pacific-10 Conference first team.  Forsett ended his college career on a high note, rushing for 140 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 42-36 Cal victory over Air Force in the 2007 Armed Forces Bowl.
