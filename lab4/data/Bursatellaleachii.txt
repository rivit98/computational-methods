Bursatella leachii, common name the ragged sea hare or shaggy sea hare, is a species of large sea slug or sea hare, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Aplysiidae, the sea hares.


== Distribution ==
This is a circumtropical sea hare, the only species in its genus.  It occurs in the intertidal zone and down to at least 10 m on coastal areas of the Indo-West Pacific oceans, the Caribbean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.


== Description ==

Bursatella leachii is green to greenish brown. It has a broad and short head. Its mantle is covered with papillae (finger-like outgrowths), which give it a thorny aspect. The mantle has a network-like pattern with blue eyespots (ocelli) in black spots and green areas. It moves slowly on a broad foot. There is short, sharp tail. The short parapodia (fleshy, winglike outgrowths) are fused on their rear end.
The maximum recorded length is 120 mm.


== Ecology ==
The species is usually found in estuaries and tidal pools, and more rarely on sandy bottoms. The minimum recorded depth for this species is 0 m; maximum recorded depth is 7 m. This sea hare may be found in dense concentrations or singly. It is herbivorous. The species lays egg ribbons in long green stringy tangles.


== Subspecies ==
Three subspecies have been described:

Bursatella leachii africana
Bursatella leachii guineensis Bebbington, 1969
Bursatella leachii leachii Blainville, 1817
Bursatella leachii pleii Rang, 1826 (synonym: Notarchus pleii (Rang, 1828))
Bursatella leachii savigniana Audouin, 1826 (synonyms: Bursatella savigniana Audouin, 1826 (basionym); Notarchus savignyanus )
