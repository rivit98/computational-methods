== Career ==
Igor Ivanovich Sukachov was born in the Moscow suburb of Myakinino (now Tushino). His father fought in World War II, having fought throughout the war from Moscow to Berlin. His mother was a Nazi concentration camp survivor.Having graduated the railway technical college, Sukachyov became a transport engineer and even took part in designing the Tushino railway station. However, an abrupt change of mind brought him to study theater at the Lipetsk Culture and Education College, which he graduated in 1977 with a theater director diploma. The same year he formed the band Zakat Solntsa Vruchnuyu ("Sunset manually"), which, after the release of one album on tape, broke up in 1983. Also in 1983, with Evgeny Khavtan, Sukachyov created another band, Postscriptum, which released one album (Don't Give Up!, 1982) and after his departure in 1984 joined forces with singer Zhanna Aguzarova to become the group Bravo.In 1986 he formed Brigada S, the self-described 'proletarian jazz orchestra', with guitarist Sergey Galanin, whom he knew from his Lipetsk days. They released six studio albums, featured in Savva Kulish's film The Tragedy in Rock, toured the United States and, after two line-up changes involving Galanin's quitting and returning, disbanded in 1993. In 1989 Sukachyov co-organized the Rock Against Terror event alongside Alexander F. Sklyar, which featured a speech in the defense of the rights of sexual minorities, one of the first in the Soviet Union.In 1994 Sukachyov formed Neprikasayemye, a more urban folk-oriented outfit, which released nine studio albums in 1994-2010. The band held massive tours across Russia and did several concerts with Emir Kusturica. Sukachov's solo career started in 1991; he released ten studio solo albums including My Vysotsky (2014). The melody of Sukachov's song "Napoi menia vodoi" ("Quench my thirst") was used in Robert Miles's 1995 song Children.In 1988 Sukachov started his career in cinema, appearing in twenty films and directing three more himself, mostly in the 1990s. In 1999 Sukachyov published his first book, The King of the Boulevard (Korol prospekta), followed by Where the Rain Ends (Gde konchayetsa dozhd, 2001).
