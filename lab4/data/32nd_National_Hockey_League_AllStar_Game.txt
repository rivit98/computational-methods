=== Notes ===
Gary Sargent named to Wales team, but unable to participate due to injury. Although it was the biggest stage the sport's two greatest players ever shared, Gretzky and Howe, the game always will be remembered for the thunderous standing ovation fans showered upon Howe, Gretzky's childhood idol and one of the Motor City's most fabled sports legends. Howe was introduced last by the PA announcer and received a standing ovation for four minutes, before the announcer interrupted the crowd.
