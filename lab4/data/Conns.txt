== History ==
In 1890, Edward Eastham founded Eastham Plumbing and Heating Company in Beaumont, TX. First National Bank of Beaumont took over the company and renamed it Plumbing and Heating, Inc. in 1931. Plumbing and Heating, Inc. hired Carol Washington Conn, Sr. in 1933. He purchased the company one year later and changed the name to Conn Plumbing and Heating Company.
In 1937, Conn's began selling refrigerators and soon added gas ranges to its inventory. By 1940, Conn had purchased a store building and moved the company to 268 Pearl Street in Beaumont. The company's second store opened in 1959 on Eleventh Street in Beaumont.
C.W. Conn, Jr. joined the company in 1953 after serving in the Korean War. He recognized that customers needed dependable, quality service and founded Conn's retail service repair and maintenance subsidiary company, Appliance Parts and Service, in 1962. In 1964, he co-founded Conn Credit Corporation, a retail credit financing services company, to provide retail credit financing services to Conn's customers.

The Year 1966 found the company with four stores and a total sales volume of $4 million. Lake Charles, Louisiana was the site of Conn's first out-of-state store opened in 1969.

In 1993, Conn's experienced its first $100 million sales volume year and opened its first San Antonio, Texas location. Thomas Frank, Sr. became Chairman of the Board of Conn's in 1994.

In July, 1998, the company reorganized and brought in a new financial partner, The Stephens Group, Inc.

On July 3, 2014, Conn's was featured in the New York Times in the biweekly column called The Haggler. The article sparked a social media backlash, concentrated around the hashtag "#talktothehaggler". A follow-up column, continuing the critique of the company's customer service, was printed on July 19. On November 9, 2014, the Haggler column reported that Conn's did not return inquiries about its alleged practices of offering credit to high-risk customers, a lawsuit over which is currently underway.Haggler columnist David Segal reported as follows: "bonuses for the company’s chief executive, Theodore M. Wright; its chief operating officer, Michael J. Poppe; and its chief financial officer, Brian E. Taylor — named defendants in the suit — were largely tied to the company’s operating income. [Wright's] maximum bonus of $850,000 would be achieved if Conn’s booked $165.8 million in operating income in 2014, according to the suit. The company came close, with $162 million. Mr. Wright took home a $820,000 bonus. The complaint also states that both he and Mr. Poppe also sold shares of Conn’s in 2013, the period when the plaintiffs maintain that those shares were “artificially inflated.” Mr. Wright had not sold any shares since 2007. In 2013, he sold enough to yield $1.9 million. Mr. Poppe cashed out $2.6 million the same year. In this way top executives at Conn’s benefitted from the credit-for-all strategy, with big bonuses and well-timed stock sales.
