== Reception ==
Amy Davies of TechRadar gave the camera four stars out of five, describing it this way: "Sony has produced a very good camera in the Alpha a58, and we're sure that anybody who buys one will be very pleased with its performance, [...] it also offers excellent value for money, especially compared with its closest rivals." Imagine Resource regarded image quality ("in fact, the A58's images stack up well against those from much more expensive, enthusiast-level DSLRs"), sharpness and graphical user interface.
