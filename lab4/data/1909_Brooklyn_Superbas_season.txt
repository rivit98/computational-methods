The 1909 Brooklyn Superbas handed the manager's job over to outfielder Harry Lumley. However, the team finished in sixth place again and Lumley's playing stats took a tumble as he tried to do both jobs. He was replaced as manager after the season and traded as a player halfway through the next season.
