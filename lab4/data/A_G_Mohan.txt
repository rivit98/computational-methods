Mohan was a longtime disciple of Tirumalai Krishnamacharya (1888-1989), the "father of modern yoga".Mohan co-founded with T.K.V. Desikachar the Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram in Chennai, India, and was its Honorary Secretary from its inception, in 1976, to 1989. Mohan was the convener of Krishnamacharya's centenary celebrations.

== Recognition by Krishnamacharya ==
In the foreword to Yoga for Body, Breath, and Mind, Krishnamacharya states:

Now my sons, Venkata Desikachar and Mohanasarma, who are jointly studying under me, have attained this status of sathirthyas.  Sathirthya means "studied under one Guru," says Amarasimha.  This gives me the satisfaction that I have not taught the shastras (the sacred treatise) to an undeserving person.  Let one, two, or many students learn from one teacher about a particular subject, or varied subjects or shastras.
But what is special here is that Mohan has studied the Patanjali Yoga Sutras and its practical application entirely from me.  He is competent to teach asana and pranayama suitable to each individual.  He is also competent to teach the asana and pranayama portions of other shastras which he has studied thoroughly.  He has studied the Samkhya philosophy in depth.  In Ayurveda he has studied the important portions of Nidana sthanam (diagnosis), Cikitsa sthanam (treatment), Vimana sthanam (causes of disease), and Garbha sthanam (constitution of body).


== Svastha Yoga & Ayurveda ==
The Mohans offer their teachings in India and internationally under the banner of Svastha Yoga & Ayurveda.  The word svastha in Sanskrit literally means "to stay in oneâ€™s own abode" and refers to the state of complete health and balance.   Svastha Yoga & Ayurveda advocates an integrated approach using yoga and ayurveda to achieve the state of svastha.
