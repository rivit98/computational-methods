The White Memorial Building is a Gothic-style building prominently located on the main downtown street of Syracuse, New York.  It was designed by Joseph Lyman Silsbee.
It is built primarily of Ohio sandstone blocks and red brick, plus Onondaga limestone along the base.  Lines of cement were black, and there are occasional lines of black brick, providing "sharp dissimilatudes" which are "yet exceedingly pleasant to the eye", according to an 1876 review.  The style is Gothic overall, though the roof is termed French.
