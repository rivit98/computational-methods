== History ==
Menen's position near the French border led to many sieges in the history of the city. There were as many as 22 sieges between 1579 and 1830.
The city was part of France between 1668 and 1713. Vauban turned Menen into a model-fortification (1679–1689).
The city was besieged and taken by the Duke of Marlborough's allied Army in August 1706. During the Flanders Campaign of the Wars of the French Revolution the city changed hands several times. There was a devastating fire in 1750 that almost completely destroyed the city. It was also the scene of a battle in September 1793.
Menen was a barrier town for the Dutch Republic against France from 1715 to 1781.
In 2013 the city drew international attention by forbidding its civil servants to speak French with francophones. The mayor, Martine Fournier, ordered that, if necessary, the communication should be in sign language.


== Culture ==
A new art museum, the Stadsmuseum ’t Schippershof, opened in 1999 which holds many works by Menen-born sculptor Yvonne Serruys. Opposed to 't Schippershof there is the cultural center CC De Steiger that houses the city's theater, public library and a concert space for live music.
