This is a list of former radio transmitters across Canada that were used by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Most of the former transmitters operated on the AM dial as low-power relay transmitters (LPRT's), which were added to vast remote communities on the AM dial, initially 20 watts of power when they first went on the air during World War II and were later boosted to 40 watts. Since the 1980s, most of the CBC AM LPRT's, including medium and high-power AM transmitters have either moved to the FM dial or shutdown completely in which the trend continues today. Note that only a few FM transmitters listed below had shutdown as well due to various reasons.
