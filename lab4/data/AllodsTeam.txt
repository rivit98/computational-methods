=== Allods Online ===
Allods Online is a fantasy multiplayer online role-playing game based on the famous Allods/Rage of Mages series of games. Along with the typical MMORPG activity (fighting monsters, completing quests, improving the characteristics of your character, etc.), Allods Online features the so-called Astral travels, a unique concept that gives players the opportunity to build and pilot their own Astral ship, which offers a variety of end-game PvE and PvP options.
Many elements in the game refer to specific historical periods of development of the Russian state, like some of the architecture. Kania's, for example, is reminiscent of that of medieval Russia, and Xadagan is an obvious reference to the totalitarian regime of Stalin's era.


=== Skyforge ===
Skyforge is a MMORPG set in a universe where mortals and immortals fight for survival against mythical creatures and invaders from space using cutting-edge technologies. Players start as immortals newly reborn into the world and vie to become gods themselves. The game has been in development since 2010.First screenshots of the game were revealed at the private Skyforge showcase at the Russian Game Developers Conference 2012. The game was announced at Game Developers Conference in March 2014.
