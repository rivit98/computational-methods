She became an activist in support of the Welsh Labour Party miners' strike of 1984–1985.

She was also a member of the Swansea Valley Women’s Support Group. She dedicated her life to numerous social causes including LGBT rights. She served as director of the Dulais Valley Partnership from 1998–2001, an organization that "finds solutions to the social and economic deprivation of the Dulais Valley".

In the 2014 film Pride, Headon was portrayed by English actress Imelda Staunton. Staunton won the British Independent Film Award and received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance as Headon, who died while the film was in production in the autumn of 2013.Headon's contributions during the 1984–1985 Miners' Strike were chronicled in the book by Hywel Francis, History on our Side: Wales and the 1984–1985 Miners’ Strike. A new edition of the book was released in 2015, dedicated to the memory of Headon. Francis stated that Headon "played a critical role in building the very special alliance between LGSM (Lesbian & Gay Men Support the Miners) and our local support group". He also said of Hefina Headon that she was "quite outstanding in her courage and political leadership, in her public speaking (including the big Afan Lido Rally), fundraising, picketing and unique style of minute taking".In 2006, Welsh artist Jacqueline Alkema created an art exhibit titled Women with a Past, featuring Hefina Headon as one of six women. Alkema painted portraits of each woman, stating "I found something encapsulating about them, these were fighters and active women and the strike was still with them".
