She is known for having made a cover about "Headlines" by Drake which received 2 million views on YouTube. In 2012 she released her very first mixtape Skye High. On the mixtape, her song "Trippin" got her a significant amount of exposure. She was also known for being Tumblr famous at the time with her then boyfriend Glyn Brown who pursued fashion. They would have meet ups in the New York area in which those who were a part of their fanbase would show up and show support for their events. As she continued on her rise to fame, her debut seven-track EP, Everyday Living, helped her land a deal with Atlantic Records in 2013. Her song "Hard Work" landed on BET's 106 & Park Top 10 and she also performed on an episode. She released the album Emotionally Unavailable in 2015. During that time she made the song, produced by DJ Mustard, "Collide" that featured the rapper Tyga.

In October 2018, Skye shared the video for "Build" on Instagram with an accompanying message that described an unnamed abuser who hurt her mentally and physically. At the time, Skye explained that she did not reveal her abuser's name because it would not matter to most people.
