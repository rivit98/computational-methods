A Charentais melon is a type of cantaloupe melon, Cucumis melo var. cantalupensis.
It is a small variety of melon, similar in flesh to cantaloupes, but with a more fragrant smell. While it's precise origin is unclear, it goes back to (at least) the 16th century in France.  Most are now produced in North Africa, with some limited production in the United States.
