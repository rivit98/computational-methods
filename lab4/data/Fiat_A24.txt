The Fiat A.24 was an Italian water-cooled aircraft engine from the 1920s, built in modest numbers. It produced 520 kW (700 hp).


== Design and development ==
During the second half of the 1920s Fiat introduced several water-cooled aircraft engines, including the A.20, A.22, A24, A.25 and A.30.  They were all upright V-12s with 60° between the cylinder banks; capacities ranged between 18.7 L and 54.5 L (1,141-3,326 cu in) and power outputs between 320 kW and 745 kW (430-1,000 hp).Producing 520 kW (700 hp) from 32.3 L (1,971 cu in), the A.24 was towards the centre of this range.  When Fiat were advised by the government to simplify their water-cooled product line, they decided to focus on the A.20, A.22 and A.30 models so that the A.24 was not manufactured in large numbers.
