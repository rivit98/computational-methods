 CC Lockwood's Bio
"C.C. Lockwood was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1949 and grew up in Fort Smith, Arkansas, where he graduated from Southside High School. He moved to Louisiana in 1967 to attend Louisiana State University, where he received his B.S. in Finance in 1971. During his early years in Louisiana he fell in love with the state’s swampy backcountry, and he abandoned plans for a career in business as soon as he graduated. He taught himself photography and headed for wild places, determined to make a living capturing images of nature. Much of this time has been on a houseboat. He has been married to Sue Richardson since 1996.
He is currently working on a book entitled Sustainable AG and editing and digitalizing his early work. His photographs are held in many personal, museum and corporate collections. Most recently, he was honored as a "Louisiana Legend" by Louisiana Public Broadcasting, "Conservation Communicator of the Year" by the Louisiana Wildlife Federation, and a Distinguished Alumni by LSU. He continues to row white water rivers of the west and explore the wetlands of Louisiana.
