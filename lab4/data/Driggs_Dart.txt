The Driggs Dart was an American-built light sporting aircraft of the late 1920s.


== Development ==
Ivan Driggs designed the Dart I single-seat high-wing monoplane in 1926. In 1927 he developed the design into the two-seat Dart II, which was a sesquiplane - a biplane whose lower wing area is less than 50% of the area of the upper wing.


== Operational history ==
Three examples of the Dart I monoplane were constructed and the type won the 1926 Ford Air Tour category for light planes. One was tested by the U.S. Army Air Corps as an observation aircraft, but no orders were received.The Dart II sesquiplane followed in 1927, at least four examples being built by Driggs and some further planes by amateur constructors from plans during the early 1930s. A Dart II is maintained in airworthy condition by the Historic Aircraft Restoration Museum at Dauster Field Creve Coeur, Missouri near St Louis.
