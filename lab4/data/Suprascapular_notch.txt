The suprascapular notch (or scapular notch) is a notch in the superior border of the scapula, just medial to the base of the coracoid process.
This notch is converted into a foramen by the superior transverse scapular ligament, and serves for the passage of the suprascapular nerve (but not its corresponding artery); sometimes the ligament is ossified. The suprascapular artery travels superiorly to the superior transverse ligament.According to Rengachary et al. 1979, there are six basic types of scapular notch:
Type I (8%): Notch is absent.  The superior border forms a wide depression from the medial angle to the coracoid process.
Type II (31%): Notch is a blunted V-shape occupying the middle third of the superior border.
Type III (48%): Notch is U-shaped with nearly parallel margins.
Type IV (3%): Notch is V-shaped and very small.  A shallow groove is frequently formed for the suprascapular nerve adjacent to the notch.
Type V (6%): Notch is minimal and U-shaped with a partially ossified ligament.
Type VI (4%): Notch is a foramen as the ligament is completely ossified.
