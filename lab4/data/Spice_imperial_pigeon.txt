== Taxonomy ==
The spice imperial pigeon was formally described in 1786 by the Austrian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli and given the binomial name Columba myristicivora. The specific epithet myristicivora combines the botanical genus name Myristica that contains the nutmeg (from the Ancient Greek muristikos  meaning "fragrant"), with the Latin -vorus meaning "eating". The type locality is New Guinea. This species is now placed in the genus Ducula that was introduced by the English naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1836.Two subspecies are recognised:
D. m. myristicivora (Scopoli, 1786) – Widi Islands (off northeast Moluccas), Raja Ampat Islands (west of New Guinea)
D. m. geelvinkiana (Schlegel, 1873) – islands in Geelvink Bay (west New Guinea)The subspecies D. m. geelvinkiana is sometimes treated as a distinct species, the Geelvink imperial pigeon (Ducula geelvinkiana).
