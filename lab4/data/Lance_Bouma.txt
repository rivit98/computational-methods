Upon his team's elimination from the 2010 WHL Playoffs, Bouma played his first professional games, joining the Flames' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Abbotsford Heat, for five playoff games. He scored one goal, against the Hamilton Bulldogs in the second round of the AHL playoffs. Bouma joined the Heat full-time for the 2010–11 AHL season, and with 11 goals through his first 49 games, was approaching his best career best goal total at any level.On February 3, 2011, Bouma received his first NHL recall by the Flames.
