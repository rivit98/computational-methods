"It's in Your Eyes" is a single performed by Phil Collins and released in 1996 as the second single from his album Dance into the Light.
A Beatles-esque melody, the song only reached #30 UK Singles Chart and fared worse on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, reaching #77. However, the song did reach the top 10 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.
For promotional live performances of the song, Collins played the lead guitar instead of Daryl Stuermer. The video showed Collins in an apartment block, playing the guitar while watching people pass by through their flats.
