2003 QX113, also written as 2003 QX113, is a detached object that was discovered when it was near aphelion. With an absolute magnitude of 4.7, it may be a dwarf planet. This has an orbit in the Kuiper belt region, home to the dwarf Planet Pluto, however this body has an even more eccentric orbit than Pluto.
As of February 2016 located 59.9 AU from the Sun, it will have moved beyond 60 AU by 2017 and will reach its aphelion around 2058. It last came to perihelion around 1883. Its current distance makes it one of the twelve most distant known minor planets in the Solar System (see table below).


== Size estimate ==

When 2003 QX113 was first discovered, it was estimated to have an absolute magnitude (H) of 4.9, giving it an assumed size of only 461 kilometres (286 mi) in diameter. As of 2010, 2003 QX113 is estimated to have a brighter absolute magnitude (H) of 4.7. Assuming it is a trans-Neptunian object with a generic albedo of 0.09, it is about 505 kilometres (314 mi) in diameter.It has been observed 23 times over six oppositions and has an orbit quality of 4.
