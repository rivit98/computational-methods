All I Need is the second studio album by English singer-songwriter Foxes, released on 5 February 2016.


== Background ==
Foxes started work on the album in January 2015 in Los Angeles. Commenting on the album's direction, Foxes said "I was inspired a lot more with this record with stripping things back and making it a lot more emotional. I didn't want to do a concept album, I always like it when I can write from a diary in a way. It's quite an emotional album. It's got elements from the first one, but it's definitely not as produced. The tracks feel a lot more vocal [with] piano and strings. It's still cinematic in ways but I'm a lot more honest on this record this time around, which is quite a scary thing to be." She has also said that the album was inspired by relationships. The album was originally scheduled to be released in October 2015 but the album was pushed back to 5 February 2016 so it could be released worldwide.
