The IEEE Education Society (EdSoc) is a society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) that is focused on the theory and practice of education and educational technology needed to deliver effectively domain knowledge in the fields of interest of IEEE.  The society is an international organization concerned with state-of-the-art information and resources related to engineering education and with professional development within academia and industry.  Membership is open to professionals in an IEEE-designated field as evidenced by educational background or by experience as well as to students who are pursuing undergraduate or graduate education in an IEEE-related field.


== History ==
The IEEE Education Society was formed on 14 June 1957 as the Professional Group on Education (PGE) of the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE). (The IRE and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) merged to form IEEE in 1963.) The founder and first chairman of IRE-PGE was John D. Ryder, a past president of the IRE. After several name changes, IEEE Professional Technical Group on Education (1963), IEEE Professional Group on Education (1965), and IEEE Education Group (1966), the Society became the IEEE Education Society on 22 October 1978.The society has members and chapters globally. In addition to its publications, conferences, and awards activities, the society and its chapters sponsor professional development events such as Distinguished Lecturer Programs. It collaborates with other bodies, inside and outside of IEEE, with shared interests such as complementary awards with the IEEE Educational Activities Board, the ASEE Electrical and Computer Engineering Division, and IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu.
