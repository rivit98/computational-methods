== History ==
The Hong Kong Open (also known as the Salem Open) was also previously a men's tennis tournament that was held in Hong Kong on the Grand Prix tour from (1973–1987) and the ATP Tour from (1990–2002). Players competed in the Victoria Park Tennis Centre, on outdoor hard courts. Michael Chang held the record number of wins with three titles.
In 2001, as with legislation restricting tobacco sponsorship, organisers controversially altered its official logo to include the logo of Perrier, causing anti-smoking campaigners to claim that the organisers exploited a loophole in its sponsorship clause.The men's tournament was replaced in 2003 by the Thailand Open.
A women's competition was also held in Hong Kong from 1980 to 1982; and then once more in 1993, as a Tier IV event on the WTA Tour. Wendy Turnbull won two titles in this competition. Starting from 2014, the Hong Kong Tennis Open was again held as a WTA International event and has attracted many top players since.
In July 2014, it was announced that Prudential Hong Kong would become the tournament's title sponsor to mark the return of elite women's professional tennis to Hong Kong after two decades.  The Prudential Hong Kong Tennis Open 2014 took place at the Victoria Park Tennis Stadium from 8–14 September. Among the competitors were women's doubles pair Peng Shuai and Hsieh Su-wei and Wimbledon finalist Sabine Lisicki.
In 2018, the tournament was awarded the WTA International Tournament of the Year.The 2019 Hong Kong Open has been postponed due to 2019 Hong Kong protests.
