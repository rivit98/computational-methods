== Critical reception ==
Deborah Evans Price, reviewing the album for Billboard magazine, states, "Pardon the pun, but Christian hip-hop has frequently gotten a bad rap for being second rate. Grits demonstrates otherwise with this disc." Awarding the album four stars from Jesus Freak Hideout, writes, "the album is different from what you might expect from Grits." Tony Cummings, giving the album an eight out of ten for Cross Rhythms, says, "Well up to the guys' usual high standards." Rating the album four stars at Christianity Today, Andree Farias describes, "well-produced disc with semi-capable hooks." Brenten Gilbert, indicating in a four star review from Rapzilla, responds, "Dichotamy A will certainly turn a few heads, and turn a few preconceived notions on end." Signaling in a three and a half star review at The Phantom Tollbooth, Len Nash replies, "Dichotomy A is stepping up and out of yesteryear". Josh McConnell, allocating four and a half stars to the album for Renown Magazine, reports, "Be sure to check this one out, because as they say in rap lingoâ€¦ 'This junk is hot, dawg!'"
