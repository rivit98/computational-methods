Donoghue was elected to the ICJ on September 9, 2010 to fill the place left vacant by the resignation of Thomas Buergenthal. Pursuant to the Statute of the International Court of Justice, Donoghue completed the remainder of the nine-year term for which Buergenthal had been elected, which expired on February 5, 2015.Donoghue's name had been the only nomination for this ICJ vacancy received by the Secretary-General within the specified time. (After the expiration of the deadline for submissions of nominations, the Secretariat received communications from the national group of Colombia also nominating a candidate.) In the General Assembly, Donoghue received 159 votes out of 167 valid ballots (there were 8 abstentions). In the Security Council, she received all 15 votes. Donoghue was sworn in as a member of the ICJ on September 13, 2010.Although the ICJ was established in 1945, Donoghue was only the fourth woman elected to be a member of the Court. Of the Court's 15 members, three are now female (the others are Xue Hanqin, sworn in on the same day as Donoghue, and Julia Sebutinde, who joined the Court in 2012).. Previously,  Rosalyn Higgins served both as judge and as president of the Court (1995-2009).
