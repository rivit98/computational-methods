"Stursberg recreated the story of his family in China for No Foreign Bones in China, recalling the turbulent birth of modern China through the Opium Wars, the Boxer Rebellion, two world wars and the rise of Mao. It traces the fortunes of Captain Samuel Lewis Shaw, a merchant seaman, who arrived in China in the 1830s. He settled in Foochow and married a Japanese woman, Peter Stursberg's grandmother, to whom the book is dedicated. The Shaw children grew up in Pagoda Anchorage, the heart of the Chinese tea trade. The title refers to the fury of the Chinese over the Korean War. They expelled all foreigners and even dug up their bones, including the bones of Stursberg's grandfather and grandmother."Through his ancestors, Captain Shaw and his Japanese wife, Stursberg is related to former British Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith.Peter Stursberg is the father of former CBC executive Richard Stursberg. His granddaughter, Trina Maus, is a news reporter for CTV. Peter Stursberg died in 2014, on his 101st birthday, in Vancouver, British Columbia.
