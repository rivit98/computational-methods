== Background ==
"A Man In Love" is the first song by Super Junior that simultaneously released a remixed version along with the original. Although not an official released promotional single, the remixed version of the song was chosen to be a semi-promo single for the repackaged versions of Don't Don. Super Junior made their first performance of "A Man In Love" on November 17, 2007 at the 2007 M.NET/KM Music Festival. They performed the same song a second time at the 2007 Golden Disk Awards on December 14, 2007. On December 31, 2007 they completed the year by performing the same track on a countdown special for KBS.


== Music style ==
"A Man In Love" music style emphasizes the huge influence of tribal instruments with a mixture of modern hip hop music, heavy beat, rhythm and blues and urban pop with a combination of soul music. Percussion instruments such as the traditional African djemba and the Indian tabla were heavily used throughout the song to heighten the dynamics and tribal theme. The Korean gayageum was used to support the melody and chorus of the song. The remixed version of "A Man In Love" includes an extended rap bridge in the beginning of the song and a drum instrumental performed at the middle of the song.
The choreographed dance provided for the song is intense, as the choreography requires frequent jumping, stomping, and also extreme street dancing.
