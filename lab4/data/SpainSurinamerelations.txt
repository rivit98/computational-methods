== Colonial era ==
Christopher Columbus sighted the islands in 1498, but only up to 1593 explorers Spaniards returned to the area, called Suriname, because it was inhabited by the Surinen, a group taíno.
During the first half of the 17th century there were unsuccessful attempts by Spaniards, British, French and Netherlands to settle in place, largely due to the resistance of natives, breaking that resistance in 1651, when the Englishman Francis Willoughby established an advance in what he is currently Paramaribo.


== Diplomatic relations ==
Spain maintains diplomatic relations with Suriname since 1976. The Embassy resident in Port of Spain (Trinidad and Tobago) is accredited before the Surinamese Authorities. Ambassador José María Fernández López de Turiso presented his style copies to the MAE in April 2014, and presented the Credentials to the President in November 2014.
