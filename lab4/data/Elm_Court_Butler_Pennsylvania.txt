== History ==
Benjamin D. Phillips, son of T.W. Phillips, founder of T.W. Phillips Gas & Oil Co, resided in this Tudor-Gothic mansion, noted often as "one of America's most spectacular private homes". The house was built for $1 million in 1929. It was completed in 1931 by Benno Janssen, a well known Pittsburgh architect.  Construction of the home was completed by master-builder Harry Wimer, whom also completed other properties in Western Pennsylvania including the T.W. Phillips Gas and Oil Company building, Union National Bank Building, and The Butler Eagle building, all located in Butler, Pennsylvania.  
Although the mansion is over 70 years old, it hasn't had many changes in ownership. Dean E. Burget and his wife, Undine Phillips Burget bought the mansion from the original owners in 1978. Frederick R. Koch purchased the mansion in 1988 for $1 million US dollars from the Burgets and the adjoining property for $900,000. Koch renovated and greatly expanded the mansion. The mansion houses the famous  Skinner Organ, Opus 783, a player instrument with full console that was completely restored in 1990.
