David H. Rosenbloom (born 1943) is a well-known scholar in the field of Public Administration. He is the Distinguished Professor of Public Administration at the School of Public Affairs at American University in Washington, D.C., and is currently serving as chair professor of public management, City University of Hong Kong.[1]  A noted authority on issues related to administrative law and public sector personnel policies, Rosenbloom is widely known for his approach to the field which stresses understanding American public administration from three perspectives mirroring the constitutional separation of powers: law, politics and management. In pursuit of that view, he has become a leading advocate for establishing "constitutional competence" as a basic standard for public service professionals.


== Education ==
Rosenbloom earned a BA in political science at Marietta College in 1964. He holds a Master of Arts (1966) and in PhD (1969) in political science, both at the University of Chicago. His master's thesis was titled “Individual Liberty versus National Security: A Critical Analysis of the Opinions of Judges E. Barrett Prettyman and Henry W. Edgerton on the Loyalty Program for Federal Civil Servants.” His Ph.D. dissertation, "The Relationship Between the Citizen and the State In Public Employment in America,” was the basis for his first book, Federal Service and the Constitution: The Development of the Public Employment Relationship (1971). He received an honorary doctorate of law in 1994, also from Marietta College.


== Career ==
Rosenbloom has served as an assistant professor in political science at the University of Kansas from 1970 to 1971. From 1971 to 1973, he visited Tel Aviv University, where he guest-lectured in the field of political science. From 1973 to 1978, he was an associate professor of political science at the University of Vermont. From 1978 to 1990, he attended The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, where he held a number of titles. He was professor of public administration from 1979 to 1988. Additionally, he was appointed as professor of political science from 1987 to 1990. He was also an adjunct professor of law from 1985 to 1989. Lastly at the Maxwell School, he was distinguished professor of public administration from 1988 to 1990. Presently, in addition to being a distinguished professor at American University, he is the chair professor of public management in the Department of Public and Social Administration, at the City University of Hong Kong (visiting). In 2014, he served as book series editor for the American Society for Public Administration indicating that the disability fields do not constitute a categorical system of state agencies and services in the US.


=== Research ===
Rosenbloom is perhaps best known for coming up with three approaches that define the American foundation of Public Administration: the managerial, political, and legal.

Managerial- The Managerial foundation is used to manage the performance of organizations so that they will be successful. Key areas include administrative decision-making, managerial techniques, leaders, and employee contributions. By these elements working together, organizations are able to operate successfully.
Political- The Political approach discusses how the political officials oversee the different administrative decisions. Politicians have the final say on the laws that public administrators are tasked with executing. Within Rosenbloom's editorial "Have an Administrative Rx? Don't Forget the Politics!" he writes about the Politics/Administration Dichotomy – a principle stating that politics and administration should remain separate in the public sector which was developed by the Civil Service Reforms of the 1870s and the 1880s.  According to this article, the idea that public administration can be separated from politics is strange. He believes that if politics and public administration were separate, this approach would not work, emphasizing their inevitable interconnection.
Legal- The Legal approach was, according to Rosenbloom, the most crucial. The Rule of Law involves orderliness, comprehension, and spells out when and how tasks will be completed. Rosenbloom argues that in order to carry out their tasks, public administrators must be competent in their legal and constitutional obligations and restrictions.Rosenbloom's argument is that to understand public administration, it is not sufficient enough to use just one of the approaches, but to think of all three at the same time. Rosenbloom documents that in 1946, by making major reforms, Congress became the central authority in how public administration operated in the federal government, incorporating all three approaches. Rosenbloom argues that public administration at other levels should operate in the same way.
