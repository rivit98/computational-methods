Carlyon Glacier (79°34′S 159°50′E) is a large glacier which flows east-southeast from the névé east of Mill Mountain to the Ross Ice Shelf at Cape Murray. It was mapped in 1958 by the Darwin Glacier party of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1956–58), and named by the New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee for R.A. Carlyon, who with H.H. Ayres made up the party.
