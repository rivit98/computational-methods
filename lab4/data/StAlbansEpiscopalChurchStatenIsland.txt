St. Alban's Episcopal Church is an active parish in the Episcopal Diocese of New York, in the United States. The building is an historic Carpenter Gothic style church now located at 76 St. Alban's Place in Eltingville, Staten Island. It was built in 1865 as the Church of the Holy Comforter at what is now 3939 Richmond Avenue, the present site of the South Shore YMCA, and was designed by Richard Michell Upjohn, the son of the noted Carpenter Gothic architect, Richard Upjohn. In 1873, the building was split in half and moved to its present location, where it was re-assembled and expanded. In 1951, Holy Comforter absorbed the congregation of nearby St. Anne's Episcopal Church, Great Kills, and changed its name to St. Alban's. St. Anne's had been founded in 1929 as an offshoot of Holy Comforter.On October 29, 1982, St. Alban's was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1984, it acquired an 1883-vintage Hook & Hastings organ, believed to be the oldest pipe organ that currently exists in a Staten Island church.
