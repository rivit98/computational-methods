Internal Affairs is the solo debut from former Organized Konfusion member Pharoahe Monch, released on Rawkus Records and Priority Records. Monch creates a harder sound than heard on the previous Organized Konfusion records. The album spawned the Hot 100 hit "Simon Says".
The album is out of print because of Pharoahe Monch's refusal to record for the Geffen Records label after Universal Music Group acquired Rawkus Records from Priority. Rawkus, as well as its then-parent label MCA Records, were later folded by the Universal Music Group into Geffen Records.
To mark the album's 20th anniversary, it was reissued on October 19, 2019, becoming available digitally and on streaming services for the first time. A limited edition vinyl release is expected to be released in April 2020.
