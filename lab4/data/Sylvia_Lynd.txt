Dryhurst and her mother, the suffragist writer Nora Dryhurst (née Robinson) being Dubliners. She was educated at the Slade School of Art, and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.
Dryhurst edited one issue of the Irish nationalist paper Bean na hÉireann; she then left for England, and Helena Molony took it over. She married in 1909 a journalist and man of letters, Robert Wilson Lynd. They lived in Hampstead, London for many years.
