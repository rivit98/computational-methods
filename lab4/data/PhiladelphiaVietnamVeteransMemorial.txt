The Philadelphia Vietnam Veterans Memorial at Penn's Landing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was dedicated in 1987. The memorial includes the names of 648 servicemen who were killed in action or listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War from Philadelphia.
The memorial is designed as an amphitheatre plaza, with the names of each soldier etched in granite on the south wall. There are also ten panels depicting scenes of the War from the beginning to the final rescue of Vietnamese refugees in 1975.
Programs are held here to commemorate the lives lost during the War.
The Philadelphia Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund works to preserve and enhance the memorial, and offers education programs about the War.
