Jakarta Outer Ringroad 2 (Indonesian: Jalan Tol Lingkar Luar Jakarta 2) or JORR 2 is an under-construction toll road circling the Greater Jakarta area, running roughly parallel with the Jakarta Outer Ring Road (JORR 1) in Indonesia. This toll road will connect Soekarno-Hatta International Airport to Cilincing, crossing West Jakarta, Tangerang, South Tangerang, Depok, Bogor Regency, Bekasi Regency, Bekasi city and North Jakarta. It is expected to be able to relieve the traffic of other toll roads in the Greater Jakarta area. As of December 2019, only 11,135 kilometers (Kunciran - Serpong) has been operated, targeted to be fully operational by end of 2020.The length of this toll road is 110 kilometers which is divided into seven sections, being Cengkareng-Kunciran (14.9 km), Kunciran-Serpong (11.19 km), Serpong-Cinere (10.14 km), Cinere-Jagorawi-Cimanggis (14.64 km), Cimanggis-Cibitung (25.39 km), Cibitung-Cilincing (34 km), and access to Tanjung Priok (16.7 km).
