== History ==
Lamb Island has a rich history of food production dating back to the early 1900s. The island consisted of numerous small farms which supplied produce to the mainland Brisbane market. Due to the unique micro climate created by the islands geographic location its extremely fertile volcanic soil and the pure sand aquifers that run beneath it, the farmers were able to supply superior produce to the mainland market earlier than their mainland competitors. There were several boats (including the well known historic vessels "Roo" and "Amazon") which travelled from the upper reaches of the Brisbane river out to the island to transport the produce. The Roo would also transport supplies from Brisbane for the island's residents and weekend trippers who would visit the island. One of the well known attractions was Peggy Saunders' garden parties. Peggy Saunders was the wife of one of the original farmers and was well known for her beautiful garden which was located on the Western waterfront of the island.In the late 1970s Lamb Island, like much of South East Queensland, was developed into small residential allotments. The majority of the original farm land was subdivided with only a handful of small farming lots remaining. The island has remained largely undeveloped with the majority of the small residential lots being left as vacant land. Residential development has been limited largely due to transport costs of materials and additionally many waterfront lots suffer from erosion, especially those on the high South Eastern end of the island.
In recent years, with the popularity and resurgence of organic food, the island is gaining a reputation for its unique micro climate and organically grown produce.  In addition to commercial organic growing ventures on the island, there are a number of small community garden groups engaged in organic food and ornamental plant production together with a local artisan industry with an emphasis on Permaculture values.
The Island has a very active incorporated residents' association (LIRA - Lamb Island Resident's Association) which is regularly engaged in community improvement projects which have included native tree planting, heritage site restoration/maintenance and general facility upgrades.
