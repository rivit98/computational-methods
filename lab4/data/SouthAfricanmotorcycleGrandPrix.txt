The South African motorcycle Grand Prix was a motorcycling event that had been part of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing world championship, held intermittently from 1983 to 2004.


== History ==
The first South African grand prix was held in 1983 at the Kyalami circuit and was taken off the calendar after the 1985 season due to the Apartheid policies which were in place in the country and the subsequent boycott from many sport associations (such as the FIM and the FIA) that followed.After the Apartheid policies were abolished and the FIM removed the restrictions for South African riders and venues, the South African round returned on the calendar in 1992 on a new, shortened variant of the circuit. However, the circuit was unpopular with the drivers and was removed from the calendar from the 1993 season onwards.
In 1999, the South African grand prix returned, this time on the Phakisa Freeway and stayed until the 2004 season. That race was characterised by a hard-fought battle between Valentino Rossi and Max Biaggi.
