The Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize is annually awarded for fiction by an American woman.
The Susan B. Anthony Institute for Gender and Women's Studies and the Department of English at the University of Rochester have awarded the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize for fiction by an American woman since 1975. 
Each winner is awarded $7,500.The prize is named for a 30-year-old editor killed in an auto accident. Family, friends, and associates in the publishing industry endowed the prize as a memorial to Kafka and "the literary standards and personal ideals for which she stood".
The prize is not associated with the similarly named Franz Kafka Prize.
