Pasir Salak is a mukim and historical riverside town in Perak Tengah District, Perak, Malaysia, about 45 minutes from the state capital, Ipoh.
The British colonial official J.W.W. Birch, who had been sent to take up the position of the first British Resident in Perak, was assassinated at Pasir Salak as the result of a conspiracy involving the local chiefs Dato Maharaja Lela and Sepuntum. The British responded to Birch's assassination with a military intervention during the Perak War.
Today, Pasir Salak is also the name of the parliamentary constituency.
