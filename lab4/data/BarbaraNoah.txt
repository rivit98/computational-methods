She teaches Interdisciplinary Art, including classes about concepts and process/maker skills in painting, drawing, and hybrid works that combine conceptual and cultural influences. These include possible mixtures of painting, drawing, sculptural components, found objects and materials, assemblage, collage, and other media. She also teaches classes based on concepts like social justice, humor, the narrative, and creativity.

Her most recent series, Toss and Turn, was recently exhibited in a solo show at Davidson Galleries in Seattle.
