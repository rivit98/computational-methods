Geranyl acetate is a natural organic compound that is classified as a monoterpene. It is a colorless liquid with a pleasant floral or fruity rose aroma. Its condensed liquid has a slightly yellow color. Geranyl acetate is insoluble in water, but soluble in some organic solvents such as alcohol and oil.
Geranyl acetate is a natural constituent of more than 60 essential oils, including Ceylon citronella, palmarosa, lemon grass, petit grain, neroli, geranium, coriander, carrot, Camden woollybutt, and sassafras.   It can be obtained by fractional distillation of essential oils.
Geranyl acetate is an ester that can be prepared semi-synthetically by the simple condensation of the more common natural terpene geraniol with acetic acid.
Geranyl acetate is used primarily as a component of perfumes for creams and soaps and as a flavoring ingredient. It is used particularly in rose, lavender and geranium formulations where a sweet fruity or citrus aroma is desired.
It is designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).
