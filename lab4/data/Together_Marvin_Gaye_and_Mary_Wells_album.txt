Together is the first and only studio album released by the duo team of American Motown artists Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells. It was released on the Motown label on April 15, 1964. The album brought together the rising star Gaye with Wells, an established star with a number-one pop hit to her name (1964's "My Guy"), singing mostly standards and show tunes, in the hopes that Gaye would benefit from the exposure.This album became the first charted album credited to Gaye, peaking at number forty-two on the Billboard Pop Albums chart and yielding two top twenty singles, "Once Upon a Time" and "What's the Matter with You Baby". Shortly afterwards, Wells, who received bad advice from her former husband and manager, left Motown upon reaching twenty-one. The label had to find another duet partner for Gaye, enlisting Kim Weston for one album, Take Two, also consisting of similar material, but later yielding a longer-lasting pairing of Gaye with Tammi Terrell, with more contemporary material.
