In category theory, a branch of mathematics, for any object 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   in any category 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
   where the product 
  
    
      
        a
        ×
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\times a}
   exists, there exists the diagonal morphism 

  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            a
          
        
        :
        a
        →
        a
        ×
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta _{a}:a\rightarrow a\times a}
  satisfying 

  
    
      
        
          π
          
            k
          
        
        ∘
        
          δ
          
            a
          
        
        =
        i
        
          d
          
            a
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{k}\circ \delta _{a}=id_{a}}
   for 
  
    
      
        k
        ∈
        {
        1
        ,
        2
        }
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle k\in \{1,2\},}
  where 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{k}}
   is the canonical projection morphism to the 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -th component. The existence of this morphism is a consequence of the universal property that characterizes the product (up to isomorphism). The restriction to binary products here is for ease of notation; diagonal morphisms exist similarly for arbitrary products. The image of a diagonal morphism in the category of sets, as a subset of the Cartesian product, is a relation on the domain, namely equality.
For concrete categories, the diagonal morphism can be simply described by its action on elements 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   of the object 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  . Namely, 
  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            a
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        x
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta _{a}(x)=\langle x,x\rangle }
  , the ordered pair formed from 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . The reason for the name is that the image of such a diagonal morphism is diagonal (whenever it makes sense), for example the image of the diagonal morphism 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
        →
        
          
            R
          
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \rightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{2}}
   on the real line is given by the line that is the graph of the equation 
  
    
      
        y
        =
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle y=x}
  . The diagonal morphism into the infinite product 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X^{\infty }}
   may provide an injection into the space of sequences valued in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  ; each element maps to the constant sequence at that element. However, most notions of sequence spaces have convergence restrictions that the image of the diagonal map will fail to satisfy.
