I thought it was captain Steve Edge [playing a trick]. “He said, "No, it’s Jack". I was an import, and you were only allowed 12. Jack said: "I thought I should ring you before you get tomorrow’s paper. I never graded you. I regard you as a first grader, but I’ve got a couple of blokes here I’m going to use more than you and I don’t think you want to play reserve grade. “I said "Jack, what a thing to do when I’m am import!". "He said, "I’ve been sacked by plenty of places and I’ve always come back, and you will. Somebody will find you", and he hung up.In 1981, Platz signed with Penrith and played there for three years before retiring at the end of the 1983 season.
