== Behind the scenes ==
Claiming to be one of the most expensive gay films of its time (nearly $100,000 to produce), Centurians of Rome is famous for reportedly having been financed from a 1980 theft of almost $2 million by a Brink's security guard.  Lloyd's of London, an insurer of Brinks, thus became one of the co-owners of the film on a technicality.
