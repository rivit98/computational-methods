Sven is a fictional character who most prominently appears in the animated film Frozen (2013) and its sequel, Frozen II (2019), produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. He is a reindeer that lives together with his companion, Kristoff. Sven, alongside Kristoff, assists princess Anna in her search for her sister, queen Elsa, who has run away after placing the kingdom of Arendelle under an eternal winter. During their adventure, Sven also meets and befriends a living snowman, Olaf. Years after the events from the first film, Sven and the others go in search of a mysterious voice heard by Elsa. In the course of the journey, Sven meets other reindeer. Besides the two films, Sven is also present in the short film Frozen Fever (2015) and the featurette Olaf's Frozen Adventure (2017).
Sven was created by Frozen directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee. In the making of Sven's character, the animation team brought a real-life reindeer into the studio in order to study its behavior and incorporate the observed elements in Sven's portrayal. Nonetheless, because of the reindeer's lack of motion, Sven's depiction was eventually developed based on the mannerisms of a dog. His appearance was designed to be realistic.
Critical reception of Sven's character has been generally positive, with journalists commending his loyalty and describing him as lovable. Reviewers have also regarded Sven as a source of comic relief, and they have praised his relationship with Kristoff. Merchandise inspired by the character has been released, including stuffed toys and action figures.


== Development ==


=== Concept and creation ===

In order to study reindeer for the development of the film Frozen (2013), produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and codirected by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, the filmmakers went to a reindeer farm management in Roros, Norway, owned by the Sami people. The animation team also decided to bring a real-life reindeer into the studio to analyze its mannerisms and implement them into Sven's portrayal. The animators remarked how the reindeer scratched behind its ears using its back legs similarly to how dogs do, and they decided to make this one of Sven's habits as well. Nevertheless, after realizing that the reindeer did not do much besides standing in the same place, the animators decided to depict Sven as "an excited dog" and "an inquisitive pooch that sniffs around the place". Animator John Lasseter highlighted the resemblance between his Labrador and Sven, which derives from how both of them act. The filmmakers had initially planned to give the name "Thor" to the character, but the idea was discarded because of the excessive usage of this name among the company.Frozen director Jennifer Lee felt Sven is the character that differs the least from the way he had been conceptualized since the filmmakers had decided from the beginning that he would never speak; she said the only change related to him in the making of the film was that his role in the story had become "bigger and bigger". Chris Buck, the other Frozen director, mentioned that he had tried to make the characters including Sven "as interesting and entertaining as possible". He further stated they had enjoyed deciding how Sven would be portrayed in the film. Buck commented that while Sven could have remained only a "pantomime character", Lee had proposed the idea of having Kristoff talk for Sven since she also does this with her cats; Buck had immediately perceived this as a "great idea" because of acting with his dogs in the same manner, and as a result the concept was incorporated in the story. Lee stated that the way Kristoff expresses Sven's thoughts is "fun". Buck further said he enjoyed how Kristoff pretended not to understand Sven when he tried to communicate with Kristoff through sounds. He described Sven and Kristoff as "best friends" and mentioned that Sven acts like his conscience. Lee commented that the filmmakers had tried to find similarities between Sven and the snowman Olaf in order to introduce the two of them in an intelligent manner during the teaser trailer for Frozen, and as a result they had decided to highlight their common interest in carrots.The sounds Sven makes such as his grunts and snorts were recorded by the voice actor Frank Welker. Jonathan Groff, who provides the English voice for Kristoff, stated that while Olaf and some animals from other Disney films have the ability to talk, Sven cannot do so. He said that he had recorded a duet with himself for one of the moments when Kristoff expressed Sven's replies. Groff mentioned that the filmmakers had informed him when he had begun his work for the film that he would also provide a "reindeer voice", adding that he had enjoyed recording it. He said that "a lot of people have weird pet voices for their pets"; according to Groff, when he and the filmmakers were "exploring the world of that", he "tried a bunch of different voices" and they "landed on the one that is Sven". In a sequence from the sequel Frozen II (2019), which is viewed from Kristoff's perspective, Sven directly talks and is also voiced by Groff.


=== Design and characterization ===
Sven's design was created in order to highlight Kristoff's disheveled appearance. He was conceptualized as "dumpy" and unappealing so that he would look realistic. His appearance was created in contrast with the design of Santa Claus's reindeer from Christmas cartoon episodes. One of Sven's earlier designs depicted him as a reindeer with just one antler. Head of the animation Lino DiSalvo stated Sven's design is far from being majestic. He added that Sven living in the wilderness without being brushed offered him a battered appearance, which provided comic relief. DiSalvo said Sven's eyebrows are expressive, adding that Sven communicates through them. Story artist Chris Williams mentioned that he had not known how reindeer looked before working on Sven, stating that he had grown up believing they were the "graceful, powerful creatures" that were portrayed in cartoons. Clio Chiang, another story artist, regarded Sven as a stubby animal and referred to him as her favorite character. Bill Schwab, Frozen II's art director of characters, said that Sven's antlers are covered with "a fuzzy coating" in this sequel since it takes place during autumn. Schwab also stated that Sven's "harness has an autumnal wheat motif", which serves as a connection to both Anna and Arendelle; he further commented that this motif is found on many elements from the film related to Arendelle. He mentioned that while "Sven stands out" among the other reindeer from Frozen II since he is larger, "the Northuldra reindeer do feel like [they are] related to him".After being asked about the similarity between Sven and the character Maximus from the film Tangled (2010) because of their doglike behavior, Jennifer Lee stated that she could not see the resemblance, adding that Sven is "not nearly as smart as Maximus", while Chris Buck shared similar thoughts. Lee further said that reindeer resemble dogs more than horses do and mentioned that Sven was created to be "a lot more like an animal" than Maximus; she elaborated on this by stating that viewers can understand Sven's thoughts only near the end of the story and that Kristoff "speaks for him and treats him more like a pet" compared to other animals from Disney films.


== Appearances ==


=== Frozen ===

Sven is a non-speaking reindeer, who has been a companion to Kristoff since both were young. Kristoff understands what Sven communicates through his facial expressions and movements, and he sometimes voices Sven's thoughts. The two of them work together harvesting ice at the beginning of the film, with Sven pulling the sled that carries the ice. Following this, they meet several trolls that are disguised as rocks, and a female troll adopts Sven and Kristoff. Years later, the two of them travel together to the kingdom of Arendelle on the coronation day of princess Elsa. In the forest near Arendelle, they subsequently meet princess Anna, Elsa's estranged sister, who asks them to take her to the North Mountain â€” Elsa's location after fleeing from the kingdom because of unwillingly placing it under an everlasting winter. On their way, Sven and Kristoff lose their sled after being chased by wolves, but Sven convinces Kristoff to continue helping Anna nonetheless. Later, they meet a talking snowman created by Elsa, Olaf, who offers to guide them. Sven alongside the others manages to help Anna reach Elsa's newly-created ice castle, but after Elsa casts ice magic on her, the group brings Anna back to Arendelle. Soon after they leave Anna in her maids' care, Sven shows his intention to return along with Kristoff to her, and they immediately start heading toward Arendelle once they realize Anna is in danger on account of a snowstorm that is forming. On the frozen fjord near Arendelle, Sven then saves Kristoff from falling into the icy water. Because of their actions throughout the story, Sven and the others help overcome Hans, the evil acting leader of Arendelle, and contribute to Anna's permanent reunion with Elsa and to Elsa being able to bring summer back in the end. As a result, Elsa awards a medal to Sven, and Anna offers him and Kristoff a new sled.

In the short film Frozen Fever (2015), Sven contributes to the arrangements for Anna's birthday party, but he falls asleep along with Kristoff and Olaf in the meantime. They wake up because of several small living snowmen, who have been created by Elsa's sneezes and who wish to reach Anna's birthday cake. Trying to stop them, Kristoff accidentally spills a drink over Sven and himself. While running after the snowmen in an attempt to catch them, Sven ends up with his tongue stuck to an icy poll. Later, Kristoff climbs on top of Sven and holds the birthday cake in order to present it in this manner to Anna. After Anna and Elsa arrive at the kingdom's gates, Sven slices the birthday cake with the help of his antlers. Eventually, Sven brings the snowmen to Elsa's ice castle alongside Kristoff and Olaf.

On their way back to the castle after collecting many traditions, the sled pulled by Sven goes on fire. Following the sled's destruction, Sven and Olaf end up on opposite sides of a ravine. After realizing that Olaf has been approached by wolves, Sven immediately runs back to the kingdom in order to get help. Upon arriving there, he tries to explain to Kristoff what has happened to Olaf, but he manages to understand the situation only after Anna and Elsa correctly interpret Sven's message. They right away begin their search for Olaf, and when they find him covered with snow, Sven catches him by his nose and pulls him out. While heading back toward the castle, Sven stops alongside everyone else at a frozen lake, where Elsa creates a Christmas tree out of ice. Afterward, she places Olaf between Sven's antlers, and they look joyfully at the tree.


=== Frozen II ===

In the film Frozen II, three years have passed since the events from the original film. Sven spends time alongside Kristoff, Olaf, Anna, and Elsa in the kingdom of Arendelle. Later, he assists them as they play charades. After Elsa starts hearing a mysterious voice, Sven and the others leave to find answers regarding it, and they arrive at a magical forest; there, they meet a tribe called the Northuldra. Among the Northuldra, Sven encounters other reindeer. After Anna leaves with Elsa and Olaf to find the voice, Sven accompanies Kristoff when he sings about Anna. Some time later, Sven and Kristoff save Anna from several giants. Once everything is solved, Sven runs happily in a circle with the other reindeer.
