== Plot ==
Dai Davies (Eric Wyn) is a Welshman running a cash-strapped farm in modern Wales and raising his orphaned granddaughter Gwen (Sian MacLean) with the help of her godmother Nerys (Lynette Davies). When he dies unexpectedly, he leaves Gwen's guardianship to his estranged son Alan (Daniel J. Travanti), who has returned to Wales accompanied by his stepson Cliff Dean (Patrick Loomer). Alan's return pits himself against land developer Howard (Dafydd Hywel) and Cliff against Gwen's would-be suitor Gwilyn (Richard Lynch). As Alan and Gwen try to connect in the background of readying the farm's prize stallion Mabon for a race that could save the farm, Howard resorts to dirty tricks to try and force through the farm's sale.
