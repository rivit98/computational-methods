== D'Oyly baronets, of Chislehampton (1666) ==
The D'Oyly Baronetcy, of Chislehampton in the County of Oxford, was created in the Baronetage of England on 7 June 1666 for John D'Oyly, Member of Parliament for Woodstock. The title became extinct on the death of the fourth Baronet in 1773.
Cokayne notes in The Complete Baronetage that a "John D'Oyly" assumed the baronetcy and died in 1781, aged 71; at which point The Annual Register recorded that it "devolves upon Mr. D'Oyly, of Adderbury West", but Cokayne disregards this and states the relationship was not clear. Furthermore, some earlier histories of the Baronetcy suggested that William D'Oyly, the younger brother of the fourth Baronet, succeeded him, but Cokayne states that this was an "error". Cokayne states that he married a Miss Monk and had a son with her called James Monk D'Oyly.
