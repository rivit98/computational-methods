Northcote railway station is located on the Mernda line, in Victoria, Australia. It serves the north-eastern Melbourne suburb of Northcote, and opened on 8 October 1889 as Middle Northcote, being renamed Northcote on 10 December 1906.The former goods sidings, located at the down end of the station, were abolished in 1986. The crossover, also located at the Down end, was spiked out of use around this time. It was removed at a later date.
During October 1987, the double line block systems between Northcote and Merri and Northcote and Thornbury were abolished, and replaced with three positioning signalling.Boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Arthurton Road level crossing around 1987/1988.
