Cyprichromini is a tribe of African cichlids, containing seven species in two genera: Cyprichromis and Paracyprichromis. Most species are endemic to Lake Tanganyika; only C. microlepidotus has also been seen in eastern Tanzania.
The members of this tribe are small elongated fish found in schools in open waters where they feed on plankton. They are mouthbrooders.
