Charlevoix–Côte-de-Beaupré is a provincial electoral district in the Capitale-Nationale region of Quebec, Canada, that elects members to the National Assembly of Quebec.  It consists of the entire territory of the following regional county municipalities: L'Île-d'Orléans, La Côte-de-Beaupré, Charlevoix, Charlevoix-Est; larger towns are La Malbaie, Baie-Saint-Paul, and Boischatel.
It was created for the 2012 election by combining the entire former Charlevoix electoral district with most of the territory (though not most of the population) of the Montmorency electoral district, along with the part of the unorganized territory of Lac-Jacques-Cartier that Charlevoix did not already have, which was taken from Chauveau electoral district.
