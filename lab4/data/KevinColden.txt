Kevin Colden is an American comic book writer and artist, as well as a webcomic artist. His work has been published in print by Zuda Comics, IDW Publishing, Image Comics, Alternative Comics, and Top Shelf Productions.
In 2007 Colden received a Xeric Grant to complete his graphic novel Fishtown (2008); the book was nominated for an Eisner Award in 2009.


== Early life ==
Colden graduated in 2001 from the Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art.


== Career ==
Colden's career began in 2003, writing and illustrating short horror/humor stories for House of Twelve, Asylum Press and Media-Blasters. In 2006, he co-founded The Chemistry Set webcomic collective, where he created the horror comic Todt Hill with writer Neil Kleid. That year, he began illustrating covers for Sequart Research & Literacy Organization's non-fiction books. In 2007, Colden's graphic novel Fishtown, based on the Murder of Jason Sweeney, was awarded a Xeric Grant, but he declined the money in order to serialize the book with the ACT-I-VATE webcomics collective. It was published in print by IDW Publishing in Fall 2008 and was nominated for a 2009 Eisner Award in the category of Best Reality-Based Work. In December 2008, his webcomic I Rule the Night began on Zuda Comics. It was moved to the DC Comics digital app in 2010.
In 2012, Colden teamed with novelist and screenwriter John Shirley to create the first new comic book update of James O'Barr's The Crow in thirteen years, entitled The Crow: Death and Rebirth.
