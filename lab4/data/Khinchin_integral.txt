In mathematics, the Khinchin integral (sometimes spelled Khintchine integral), also known as the Denjoy–Khinchin integral, generalized Denjoy integral or wide Denjoy integral, is one of a number of definitions of the integral of a function.  It is a generalization of the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals. It is named after Aleksandr Khinchin and Arnaud Denjoy, but is not to be confused with the (narrow) Denjoy integral.


== Motivation ==
If g : I → R is a Lebesgue-integrable function on some interval I = [a,b], and if

  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          ∫
          
            a
          
          
            x
          
        
        g
        (
        t
        )
        
        d
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=\int _{a}^{x}g(t)\,dt}
  is its Lebesgue indefinite integral, then the following assertions are true:
f is absolutely continuous (see below)
f is differentiable almost everywhere
Its derivative coincides almost everywhere with g(x).  (In fact, all absolutely continuous functions are obtained in this manner.)The Lebesgue integral could be defined as follows: g is Lebesgue-integrable on I iff there exists a function f that is absolutely continuous whose derivative coincides with g almost everywhere.
However, even if f : I → R is differentiable everywhere, and g is its derivative, it does not follow that f is (up to a constant) the Lebesgue indefinite integral of g, simply because g can fail to be Lebesgue-integrable, i.e., f can fail to be absolutely continuous.  An example of this is given by the derivative g of the (differentiable but not absolutely continuous) function f(x)=x²·sin(1/x²) (the function g is not Lebesgue-integrable around 0).
The Denjoy integral corrects this lack by ensuring that the derivative of any function f that is everywhere differentiable (or even differentiable everywhere except for at most countably many points) is integrable, and its integral reconstructs f up to a constant; the Khinchin integral is even more general in that it can integrate the approximate derivative of an approximately differentiable function (see below for definitions).  To do this, one first finds a condition that is weaker than absolute continuity but is satisfied by any approximately differentiable function. This is the concept of generalized absolute continuity; generalized absolutely continuous functions will be exactly those functions which are indefinite Khinchin integrals.


== Definition ==


=== Generalized absolutely continuous function ===
Let I = [a,b] be an interval and f : I → R be a real-valued function on I.
Recall that f is absolutely continuous on a subset E of I if and only if for every positive number ε there is a positive number δ such that whenever a finite collection [xk,yk] of pairwise disjoint subintervals of I with endpoints in E satisfies

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            k
          
        
        
          |
          
            
              y
              
                k
              
            
            −
            
              x
              
                k
              
            
          
          |
        
        <
        δ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{k}\left|y_{k}-x_{k}\right|<\delta }
  it also satisfies

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            k
          
        
        
          |
        
        f
        (
        
          y
          
            k
          
        
        )
        −
        f
        (
        
          x
          
            k
          
        
        )
        
          |
        
        <
        ε
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{k}|f(y_{k})-f(x_{k})|<\varepsilon .}
  Define the function f to be generalized absolutely continuous on a subset E of I if the restriction of f to E is continuous (on E) and E can be written as a countable union of subsets Ei such that f is absolutely continuous on each Ei.  This is equivalent to the statement that every nonempty perfect subset of E contains a portion on which f is absolutely continuous.


=== Approximate derivative ===
Let E be a Lebesgue measurable set of reals. Recall that a real number x (not necessarily in E) is said to be a point of density of E when

  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            ε
            →
            0
          
        
        
          
            
              μ
              (
              E
              ∩
              [
              x
              −
              ε
              ,
              x
              +
              ε
              ]
              )
            
            
              2
              ε
            
          
        
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{\varepsilon \to 0}{\frac {\mu (E\cap [x-\varepsilon ,x+\varepsilon ])}{2\varepsilon }}=1}
  (where μ denotes Lebesgue measure).  A Lebesgue-measurable function g : E → R is said to have approximate limit y at x (a point of density of E) if for every positive number ε, the point x is a point of density of 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        [
        y
        −
        ε
        ,
        y
        +
        ε
        ]
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g^{-1}([y-\varepsilon ,y+\varepsilon ])}
  . (If furthermore g(x)  = y, we can say that g is approximately continuous at x.) Equivalently, g has approximate limit y at x if and only if there exists a measurable subset F of E such that x is a point of density of F and the (usual) limit at x of the restriction of f to F is y. Just like the usual limit, the approximate limit is unique if it exists.
Finally, a Lebesgue-measurable function f : E → R is said to have approximate derivative y at x iff

  
    
      
        
          
            
              f
              (
              
                x
                ′
              
              )
              −
              f
              (
              x
              )
            
            
              
                x
                ′
              
              −
              x
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {f(x')-f(x)}{x'-x}}}
  has approximate limit y at x; this implies that f is approximately continuous at x.


=== A theorem ===
Recall that it follows from Lusin's theorem that a Lebesgue-measurable function is approximately continuous almost everywhere (and conversely).  The key theorem in constructing the Khinchin integral is this: a function f that is generalized absolutely continuous (or even of "generalized bounded variation", a weaker notion) has an approximate derivative almost everywhere.  Furthermore, if f is generalized absolutely continuous and its approximate derivative is nonnegative almost everywhere, then f is nondecreasing, and consequently, if this approximate derivative is zero almost everywhere, then f is constant.


=== The Khinchin integral ===
Let I = [a,b] be an interval and g : I → R be a real-valued function on I.  The function g is said to be Khinchin-integrable on I iff there exists a function f that is generalized absolutely continuous whose approximate derivative coincides with g almost everywhere; in this case, the function f is determined by g up to a constant, and the Khinchin-integral of g from a to b is defined as f(b) − f(a).


=== A particular case ===
If f : I → R is continuous and has an approximate derivative everywhere on I except for at most countably many points, then f is, in fact, generalized absolutely continuous, so it is the (indefinite) Khinchin-integral of its approximate derivative.This result does not hold if the set of points where f is not assumed to have an approximate derivative is merely of Lebesgue measure zero, as the Cantor function shows.
