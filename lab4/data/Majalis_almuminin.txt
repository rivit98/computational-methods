This book is considered an important biographical work in which there is much information about notable persons who were Shia. Qazi Noorollah divided the book into twelve Majlis or sections. The fifth section was concerned with the lives of lawyers and traditionists. Qazi Noorollah does not mention the period of writing the book. Maybe the book was written in the first part of the eleventh century of the Hegira.Mirza Abdullah Afandi said the motive of writing the book was to deny belief in the appearance of Shia Islam in the Safavid dynasty. Afandi also said the book was written between the first day of Rajab and 23 Dhi Qadeh in 1010 Hijrah lunar.
