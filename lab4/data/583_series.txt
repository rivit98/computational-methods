== History ==
The 581 series was introduced in 1967 on the Midori (Shin-Ōsaka - Kumamoto daytime limited express) and Gekkō (Shin-Osaka - Hakata night limited express).
The 583 series was introduced in 1968 on the Hatsukari (Ueno - Aomori via Tōhoku Main Line daytime), Hakutsuru (Ueno - Aomori via Tōhoku Main Line night), and Yūzuru (Ueno - Aomori via Jōban Line night).
These trains were subsequently used on other limited express services.
In 1982, when the Tohoku Shinkansen opened, many cars became surplus to requirements, and some were remodeled into 419 series and 715 series EMUs.
The last remaining trainset in service, a six-car set based at JR East's Akita Depot made its final run on 8 April 2017, on a charter service between Akita and Hirosaki.
