He entered private practice in New York City from 1906 to 1907, with his father's law firm of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett. Thacher remained with the firm and was made a partner in 1914. He was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1907 to 1910. While in this position, Thacher was recognized for his work in prosecuting customs fraud.
