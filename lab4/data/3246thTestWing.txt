The 3246th Test Wing was a flight test component of the Air Proving Ground Center, later Armament Division, at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and was activated 1 July 1970 to provide weapon and countermeasures test duties. It was replaced by the 46th Test Wing in October 1992.
This unit is notable for operating the last active-duty USAF F-4D Phantom II (68-8800), relegated to the Eglin target range in July 1992.  It carried the logo "Phantoms Phorever 1963–1992". 68-8800 has been sitting on the ramp at Pierce Field (Eglin Auxiliary Field #2) since retirement. It is there in 2012.
