Komety is one of Poland 's most popular and distinctive alternative groups. Its line-up: Lesław (voice, guitar, music, words), W. Szewko (bass, voice) and Arkus (drums, voice). The group has created a characteristic musical/lyrical style all their own. Before Komety, Lesław had been the leader of the now defunct group Partia.

In 2005, the "Via Ardiente" album was released and they played at the punk rock festival Antifest in the Czech Republic. "Komety 2004-2006", featuring previously unreleased material, came out the following year.
The next album, "Akcja v1"came out in 2007. Singles taken from that album topped many Polish charts.
In early 2008, Mexico's Esquilo Records released "The Story of Komety" a collection of the group's best-known selections.
In March 2009 "Zloto Aztekow", a live album also featuring new studio recordings, came out on Jimmy Jazz Records.
