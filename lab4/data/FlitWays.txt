== Travel app ==
Users use either an online service or mobile app to enter their travel details—pick-up location, time, and destination—and are provided a comparative cost between different travel options, usually taxi, town car, and airport shuttle. Pricing is also reduced if the booking is made enough time in advance, through partnerships that FlitWays has through taxi providers. Pre-booking is also available for people integrating their ground travel into their larger travel plans. FlitWays also has partnerships with other travel companies like Megabus and Mozio, whose inventory of options can be ordered through the app. FlitWays is cashless, with all payments being made through the app or online service. The app is free and compatible with both Android and iOS. FlitWays also has an enterprise platform, which is used by corporations including Xerox and Megabus.
