The National Academy of Education (NAEd) is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization in the United States that advances high-quality research to improve education policy and practice. Founded in 1965, the NAEd currently consists of 197 elected regular members and 41 scholars in the membership categories of members emeriti, foreign associates, and foreign associates emeriti. Members and foreign associates are elected based on the outstanding scholarship related to education and provide pro-bono service on committees that address pressing issues in education. In addition, Academy members and other scholars are also deeply engaged in NAEdâ€™s professional development programs focused preparing the next generation of education researchers. Since 1986, NAEd has administered the NAEd/Spencer Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, funded by The Spencer Foundation, and beginning in 2011, NAEd also offers the NAEd/Spencer Dissertation Fellowship Program.
