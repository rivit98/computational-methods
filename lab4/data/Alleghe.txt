Alleghe (Ladin: Ã€lie) is a village and comune in the province of Belluno in the Italian region of Veneto.
To the west Alleghe borders with Alleghe Lake, which was formed in 1771 by a landslide from the adjacent Mount Piz.


== Name ==

Purists of the Italian language would derive the name Alleghe from the Latin alica or alicarius, meaning "granary", but as no grain is grown in this Alpine village, it is most likely that Alleghe is a contraction of the Ladin a l'agua, in reference the deep mountain valley that marked the western boundary of the village prior to the landslide of 1771. A community existed as far back as the 12th century CE.
