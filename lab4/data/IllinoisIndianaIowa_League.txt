The Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League was a Minor League Baseball organization that operated for the better part of 60 years, mostly in those three states. The league began play in 1901 and disbanded after the 1961 season. It was popularly known as the Three–I League and sometimes jokingly as the Three-Eye League.


== History ==
The Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League was founded in 1901 with Rock Island, IL native Michael H. Sexton serving as President. Eight charter members began play in 1901: the Bloomington Blues, Cedar Rapids Rabbitts, Davenport River Rats, Decatur Commodores, Evansville River Rats, Rock Island Islanders, Rockford Red Sox and Terre Haute Hottentots. Bloomington, Illinois, Decatur, Illinois and Terre Haute, Indiana had left the Central League to join   expansion teams in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Davenport, Iowa, Evansville, Indiana, Rockford, Illinois, and Rock Island, Illinois and form the Class D league.  Two expansion teams, Davenport and Evansville, chose  "River Rats" as their team name. For the second season, 1902, the league became Class B, a classification it retained for the next 59 seasons of league operation.The Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League was inactive during some years of World War I (1918), the Great Depression (1933–1934, 1936) and World War II (1943–1945), similar to many minor leagues that were forced to suspend operations or disband during those severe times.As with many minor leagues, especially at the lower classifications, league membership fluctuated a great deal over its six decades.  Overall, the league hosted teams in 31 cities during its existence. At various times it had teams in such medium-sized cities as Cedar Rapids, Davenport, Bloomington, Decatur, Danville, Peoria, Springfield, Evansville and Terre Haute. It was a Class B league in the old classification system that ran from Class D up to Class Triple-A.
The 1955 Keokuk Kernels are ranked #30 in the Top-100 All Time teams by MiLB.com. The Kernels finished with a 92-34 record and were led by Russ Nixon and Mudcat Grant.Since 1956 its territory had largely been supplanted by the Midwest League, which began in 1947 as the Class D Illinois State League. After 1956 there were no Illinois or Indiana teams in the league. The final 1961 Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League franchises were the Fox Cities Foxes, Burlington Bees, Topeka Reds, Lincoln Chiefs, Cedar Rapids Braves and Des Moines Demons. In 1962, Appleton (Fox Cities), Burlington, and Cedar Rapids joined the Midwest League and the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League folded operations when those franchises switched leagues.The league's unique name made it a convenient reference point for any mention of the minor leagues.  Casey Stengel made the following comment in later life, evidently still feeling stung from having been traded by the New York Giants to the Boston Braves in the 1923–1924 off-season, despite having hit 2 game-winning home runs in the World Series:  "It's lucky I didn't hit 3 home runs in three games, or McGraw would have traded me to the 3-I League!"
