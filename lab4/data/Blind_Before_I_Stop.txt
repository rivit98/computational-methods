Blind Before I Stop is the fifth studio album by Meat Loaf released in September 1986. The album was produced in Germany by Frank Farian and was the first to fully embrace the '80s sound. Critics were concerned about the album missing the characteristic Steinman-influenced sound by incorporating synth chords and samples. According to Meat Loaf's 1998 autobiography, he would have preferred to wait to work with more Steinman material, but his contractual obligations with Arista required him to complete two more albums by the end of the 1980s, including this album and a live album.
Meat Loaf co-wrote three of the songs on the album. One of them, "Blind Before I Stop", was performed live on Saturday Night Live, with Meat Loaf playing guitar. "Rock 'n' Roll Mercenaries", a duet with rock singer John Parr, was released as a single in the UK. Meat Loaf sang the song live with Parr on only one occasion and did not do so again after an incident just after the release of the single. During a sold out show in London, the singer failed to introduce Parr onto the stage and Parr walked off after the song was over. Despite leaving dozens of phone messages begging for forgiveness, Meat Loaf never heard from Parr again. During his late 1980s tour of Europe, Meat Loaf picked up pianist Frank Doyle. Richard Raskin had made contributions to arrangements on previous musical tracks some years before and his style can still be heard on bass.
On most of the songs from this album were filmed the videos (incl. the singles "Getting Away with Murder" [1] and "Rock 'n' Roll Mercenaries"). Tracks from this album were featured on the CD re-release of "Bad Attitude" in lieu of inclusion on "The Very Best" album.
