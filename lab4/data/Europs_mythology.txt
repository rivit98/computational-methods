In Greek mythology, the name Europs (Ancient Greek: Εὕρωψ) may refer to:

Europs, son of the autochthon Aegialeus, father of Telchis and grandfather of Apis, all of whom formed a legacy of the primeval kings of Sicyon according to a local legend.
Europs, son of Phoroneus whom Herophanes of Troezen wrote of as illegitimate; Pausanias concluded that Herophanes' account was plausible, since otherwise Phoroneus' kingdom would not have passed to Argus. Europs' own son Hermion was the presumed eponym of Hermione, Argolis.
