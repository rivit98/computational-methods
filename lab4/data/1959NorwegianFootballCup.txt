The 1959 Norwegian Football Cup was the 54th season of the Norwegian annual knockout football tournament. The tournament was open for all members of NFF, except those from Northern Norway. Skeid was the defending champions, but was eliminated by the second tier team Nessegutten in the fourth round.
The final was played at Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo on 25 October 1959, and was contested by Viking, which had won the cup once in 1953, and Sandefjord who played their second cup final, having lost the final in 1957.
