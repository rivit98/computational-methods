Born in Avellaneda, Buenos Aires Province, Yazalde's beginnings in football were hazardous: he was visiting a friend who played with Club Atlético Piraña, an amateur club in the Argentine capital. He asked to join the training session, immediately causing a stirring impression and signing the very day; from there, he moved to Club Atlético Independiente, going on to help the team win two Primera División championships.In the 1971–72 season, Yazalde signed with Sporting CP, helping the Lisbon side to the 1974 Primeira Liga by scoring 46 goals in just 29 matches, both a domestic and European record, and the 1973 and 1974 Portuguese Cups. The following campaign, with the Lions finishing third, he netted 30, league's best and Europe's second.As a prize for the European Golden Shoe, Yazalde received a Toyota car which he sold, then sharing the money with his teammates. After his Portuguese spell, he successively represented Olympique de Marseille, Newell's Old Boys and Club Atlético Huracán, retiring in 1981 and becoming a player's agent in his country.


== International career ==
Yazalde earned ten caps for Argentina, appearing at the 1974 FIFA World Cup where he scored twice in three matches (both against Haiti, 4–1 win).


== Personal life ==
Yazalde married Portuguese model/actress Maria do Carmo de Deus (nicknamed Carmizé) on 16 July 1973, with the couple divorcing 14 years later.
