Holbeinpferd is the colloquial name of the sculpture of a horse (in German: Pferd) in the suburb Wiehre in Freiburg im Breisgau in Baden-Württemberg, Germany which is standing at the corner of Günterstal and Holbein streets. The concrete sculpture of a foal was created in 1936 by the sculptor Werner Gürtner. It is 1.90 m both long and high and weighs nearly 1 tonne.

It became famous for the fact that since about 1980 it is frequently painted at night.
