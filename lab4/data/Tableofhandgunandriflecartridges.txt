This is a table of selected pistol/submachine gun and rifle/machine gun cartridges by common name.  Data values are the highest found for the cartridge, and might not occur in the same load (e.g. the highest muzzle energy might not be in the same load as the highest muzzle velocity, since the bullet weights can differ between loads).


== Legend ==
Factory loadings.  Number of manufacturers currently producing complete cartridges - e.g. Norma, RWS, Hornady, Winchester, Federal, Remington, Sellier&Bellot, Prvi Partizan.  May be none for obsolete and wildcat cartridges.
H/R: Handgun or Rifle - dominant usage of the cartridge (although several dual-purpose cartridges exist)
Size: Metric size - may not be official
MV: Muzzle velocity, in feet-per-second
ME: Muzzle energy, in foot-pounds
P: Momentum, in pound (force) (lbf) times seconds.  A guide to the recoil from the cartridge, and an indicator of bullet penetration potential.  The .30-06 Springfield (at 2.064 lbf-s) is considered the upper limit for tolerable recoil for inexperienced rifle shooters.
Chg: Propellant charge, in grains
Dia: Bullet diameter, in inches
BC: Ballistic coefficient, G1 model
L: Case Length (mm)
