Chongqing–Huaihua railway or Yuhuai railway (simplified Chinese: 渝怀铁路; traditional Chinese: 渝懷鐵路; pinyin: yúhuái tiělù), is a single-track, electrified railroad in southwest China between Chongqing Municipality and Huaihua in Hunan Province.  The line is 624.5 km (388 mi) long and was built between 2000 and 2005.  Cities and towns along route include Changshou, Fuling, Wulong, Pengshui, Qianjiang, Youyang Tujia and Miao Autonomous County, Xiushan, Songtao in Chongqing Municipality, Tongren in Guizhou Province and Huaihua in Hunan Province.
The Chongqing–Huaihua railway was one of the 10 major projects in the Chinese government's campaign to develop western regions in 2000.  The completion of the line shortened railway travel time from Chongqing to Zhangjiajie from 16 hours to 8 hours.
In September 2009, construction began on a second track for the Yuhuai railway.
