"The Perfect Boy" is a single by the British band The Cure which was released on 13 August 2008 on Geffen Records in the United Kingdom and on 12 August in the United States to follow the tradition of releasing the singles on a Tuesday. The song debuted on 9 May in Fairfax, Virginia on the band's first concert of their 4Tour's North American leg, and was played at all 27 shows. It is not to be confused with "The Perfect Girl" from Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me.
It is unknown at this time whether the B-side "Without You" is a retitling of a song called "Christmas Without You", a title that was mentioned in early press releases relating to 4:13 Dream.
