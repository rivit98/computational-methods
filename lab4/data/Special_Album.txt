Special Album is the only compilation album by the popular Korean girl group Baby V.O.X. The singles from this album were "Coincidence" (also known as "By Chance" or "Accident") and "Go". Their single "Coincidence" was used to promote the 2002 FIFA World Cup; a special World Cup-themed video for the song was released. "Go" was later used for their debut mini album in Japan in 2003. "Coincidence" marks their first number one hit in three years since their single "Get Up". This was their best selling album to date, selling for over 440,000 copies.
The album came with three CDs, one VCD, and a photobook containing pictures of the members. The first CD contains the two new songs plus a non-stop dance mix, mostly of previous singles. The second CD contains another dance mix, and the third CD is a collection of ballads from previous albums. The VCD contains the music video for "Coincidence" plus exclusive footage of the group.
