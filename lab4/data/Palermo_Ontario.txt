In 1875, the village had an iron foundry, two stores, and a hotel. At that time its population was 150.  By the 1870s, the village also had a wagon shop, blacksmith shop, harness shop, brick school house, churches, a telegraph office and drill shed.  The village was amalgamated with Oakville in 1962, along with Trafalgar Township and other nearby villages.
