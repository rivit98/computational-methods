Jossande de Flotte, also known as Josserande de Fleet or Josserane was a noblewoman born to Pierre Arnaud de la Flotte and Adelaide de Comps. She was born in La Flotte, which is a commune on the Île de Ré, an island in the Atlantic Ocean off the midwestern coast of France.


== Birth ==
There seems to be some debate on her exact birthdate but it has been listed on multiple sources as, 1104, 1106 and c. 1110, abt 1120. More research will need to be conducted of contemporary sources to determine the exact date.


== Family ==
She was the sister of Henri I Lambert de Flotte (c. 1090). She was married to Bertrand I, Count of Forcalquier, in the Kingdom of France around the year 1130. There is debate on the marriage date, and more research will need to be done to confirm the exact date. Some sources state that the marriage date was in 1135, yet it is a disgrace for a countess to bear a child to a count illegitimately. Since her first child with Bertrand I was born in 1130 and he is listed as legitimate heir, this would show that their marriage must have been before 1130. She then became the Countess of Forcalquier upon marrying Bertrand I, Count of Forcalquier. She bore a son, Guillaume IV in 1130, and heir to Forcalquier. She would go on to bear three other children, a son, Bertrand II (1135–1207), and daughters Alix (1150–1219) and Azalais.
