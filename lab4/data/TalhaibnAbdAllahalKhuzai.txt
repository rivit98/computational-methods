Abū Muḥammad Ṭalḥa ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Khalaf al-Khuzāʿī, better known as Talha al-Talahat literally "Talha of the Talhas" (died 684-5) was a military commander of the Umayyad Caliphate and governor of Sistan. The nickname Talha al-Talahat was because his mother was called Talha bint Abi Talha, "Talha the daughter of Talha's father". 
Around 683 (or early 684) he was appointed governor of Sistan by the governor of Khurasan, Salm ibn Ziyad, at the place of the latter's brother Yazid ibn Ziyad. Yazid had been killed in a disastrous raid on the Zunbil of Zabulistan and the shahs of Kabul in eastern Afghanistan, during which another brother, Abu Ubayda, was taken prisoner; it was necessary to ransom the Arab captives from the Zunbil or the local princes of Zamindawar and Zabulistan. Salm dismissed Talha, but later restored him to his office. He died shortly afterward in 684/5.Ruzaiq, the  ancestor of the Tahirid dynasty, became a mawla of Talha during his rule in Sistan (683–685).
