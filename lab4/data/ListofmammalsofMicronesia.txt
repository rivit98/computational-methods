This is a list of the mammal species recorded in Micronesia. There are twelve mammal species in Micronesia, of which three are critically endangered and two are endangered.The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature:

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of near threatened and least concern categories:


== Subclass: Theria ==


=== Infraclass: Eutheria ===
