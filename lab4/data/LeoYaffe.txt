== Quotes ==
"People, unfortunately, tend to equate nuclear with bombs. I'm a passionate believer in the peaceful purposes of nuclear energy. What people don't realize is how many people are being helped to surmount medical problems with nuclear medicine."
"The transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next remains for me the most noble of the professions."
