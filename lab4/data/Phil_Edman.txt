== Misconduct finding ==
In December 2019, in an interim report, the WA Corruption and Crime Commission (CCC) found that Edman had misappropriated his taxpayer-funded electoral allowance, using it for private expenditure on clothing and other items, paying speeding fines, gambling, and running a private yacht, as well as facilitating intimate relationships with various women. WA Opposition Leader Liza Harvey expressed her disgust at Edman's behaviour, and asked that the process of expelling him from the Liberal Party be commenced. It was reported that Edman had already resigned.The CCC had earlier seized a laptop and two hard drives owned by Edman, which had been believed to contain incriminating evidence due to information Edman revealed while his phone was tapped. However, they were forced to return the items as they were subject to parliamentary privilege. The WA Government demanded that the laptop be returned to the CCC for investigation upon the release of the December report.
