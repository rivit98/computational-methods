Belarus chose Dmitry Koldun with the song "Work Your Magic" to represent the nation at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki, Finland.


== Before Eurovision ==


=== Eurofest 2007 ===


==== Semi-final ====
The national final Eurofest 2007 took place on 15 December 2006. Fifteen performers competed and televoting first selected Dmitry Koldun to proceed to the final. From the remaining entries, Diana Gurtskaya and The Project was selected by the professional jury to proceed to the final.


==== Final ====
For the final, the three competitors could change their song if they wished, which Dmitry Koldun decided to perform the song "Work Your Magic" instead of "Angel Mechty", which was performed in the semi-final. On 22 January 2007, the three performed their song in front of a strict government jury, which decided that Dmitry Koldun was the most suitable performer to represent Belarus. The song was written by Karen Kavaleryan and composed by Philip Kirkorov.


=== Promotion ===
Prior to the contest, Dmitry departed on a promo tour across Europe performing in countries such as Spain, Ireland, Cyprus, and Macedonia.


== At Eurovision ==
At Eurovision, Dmitry Koldun dropped his first name and performed as Koldun, which is the Russian word for "magician". As Belarus failed to qualify from the semi-final for the third time in a row, Koldun had to compete in the semi-final on 10 May. The Belarusian entry was performed fourth, following Cyrpus and preceding the Iceland. Belarus finished 4th in the semi-final, and therefore qualified for the final on 12 May, where they performed 3rd following Spain and preceding the Ireland. The entry finished in 6th place with 145 points, which is the best result for Belarus to date. With changes to the format of the competition coming into effect for 2008, Belarus would have to compete in one of two semi-finals for qualification into the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. As Belarus was not the winner of the 2007 Contest and was not a member of the Big Four, other results in the previous contest no longer pre-qualified nations to the final of the forthcoming contest.
