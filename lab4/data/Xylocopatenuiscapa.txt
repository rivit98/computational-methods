Xylocopa tenuiscapa, or Xylocopa (Koptortosoma) tenuiscapa, is a species of carpenter bee. It is found only in South Asian and Southeast Asian countries.
Like most bees, X. tenuiscapa has a diurnal activity cycle, but in the Western Ghats of Southern India, the species flies in moonlit nights and has been observed as pollinator of nocturnally flowering trees. Males of the species perch on exposed sites close to nests or in the landscape waiting for occasions to mate.
