The Nathan Cooper Gristmill is a historic gristmill on the Black River in Chester Township, Morris County, New Jersey.From the 1760s until 1788 Isaiah Younglove milled flour on the site. Several other millers owned the mill, until Nathan Cooper (1751–1834) constructed the present mill in 1826. Later, Nathan A. Cooper (1802–1879) inherited this mill when his uncle Nathan died. Nathan A. built a house nearby for his son, Abram W. Cooper (1848–1933), who latter inherited the mill from his father. This building is now used as the visitor center. The mill is currently kept in operating condition, with the large water wheel turning shafts and gears that turn 2,000-pound mill stones. The Morris County Parks Commission owns and operates the mill. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 21, 1976 for its significance in industry.The Friends of Fosterfields and Cooper Gristmill, a non-profit organization, contributes money and expertise to run the mill.
