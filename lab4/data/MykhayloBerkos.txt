== Artworks ==

Almost all of the works of Berkos which were stored at his home (350 paintings and sketches) after his death were burned by  his wife. However, his works have been preserved in museum collections in Kharkiv, Kiev, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Ulyanovsk, Stavropol, Alupka, North Ossetia, Germany, France and Switzerland.The main theme of the artist's art throughout his career was a Ukrainian landscape, the specific features of nature, the nature of vegetation. Berkos loved to paint during blossoming. Village streets with white houses and lush trees, flowering fields of flax and buckwheat were his favorite motifs: paintings Flax in bloom (1893), Buckwheat in bloom (1894), July. Poppies are blooming (1913), Apple tree in bloom (1919). His sketches Full poppies (1885), The Valley, Flax (1893) noted completeness, reasonableness of the composition, the freshness of colour, special refinement.
Particularly noteworthy is a small picture of Berkos from the Kharkov Art Museum, 47 x 66 cm in size called "Budyaki".  The picture, like most of the master’s works, captivates one’s eyes, as much life as there is still to be found in these dried weeds!
Following the impressionistic principle that “there should be traces of how it was made in the picture,” the master uses a roundish, dotted, dense brushstroke, which creates a flickering, vibrating surface, where sunlight shines through a hot golden under-shadow through a light-air background.  In the Russian Museum of St. Petersburg is a vivid work of nature M. Berkosa "Stream".  The size of the painting is 120 by 177 cm, single, oil, year of writing 1889.

Landscapes Rome and Sorrento (1899) take the romantic colouring of past times by the reproduction of pure blue sky, bright sunshine, rich color shades of green tall trees, flowing enamel-like painting. Sketch Haven. Amalfi (1899) was depicted in light improvisational manner, it’s an elegant painting, impregnated with a dynamic movement.The colour structure of the landscape Winter (1907), painted in the Poltava region, was designed in blue and white palette with flashes of pink with elaborate decorative. In his landscapes the display of the usual corner, above all Sloboda Ukraine, turns into a generalised image of Ukraine. In his work Street in Uman (1895) the picture of a provincial Ukrainian town, its dusty roads, winding streets, ramshackle houses and domes of the churches were reflected with high authenticity.
The world that Berkos conveys sparkles with a stream of sun, light and color.
The world that Berkos conveys sparkles with a stream of sun, light and color.
He paints his paintings quickly, easily, freely.
Each picture has its own coloristic find, discovery.  There is a phenomenon called the "absolute eye" of the artist.  Among the "seasonal predilections" of the master are summer and spring, the period of the lush flowering of everything on earth.  With his hedonistic aspirations, the desire to represent the world in its entirety and brightness, the artist is perhaps most attracted to the backgrounds of Renoir and Monet, their bright multicolor.  Among the paintings of Mikhail Berkos, you can stroll, as in a flowering garden, flooded with midday light.
