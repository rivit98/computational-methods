== Background ==
Kezdy started with the band Strike Under in either 1979 or 1980.  When Steve Bjorklund, the band's lead singer, left the band in 1981, the remaining members, including Kezdy, formed a new band called Trial By Fire.  When that band folded in 1982, Kezdy went on to replace Camilo Gonzalez in Naked Raygun. Naked Raygun split up in 1990, then in 1994 Kezdy replaced Steve Saylors in Pegboy, the band started by former Naked Raygun bandmate John Haggerty. Kezdy dropped out of Pegboy in 2007 when Naked Raygun re-formed.  He was forced to drop out of Naked Raygun in 2011 after he suffered a stroke, he was replaced by Pete Mittler while he recovers.Other bands that Kezdy has played with include the Rainbow Girls (with his brother John Kezdy, of the Effigies), the Interceptors and Arsenal (both with Santiago Durango).

== Reception ==
"Ex-Raygun bassist Pierre Kezdy's steely edge is further ferocious: even his old favorite J.J. Burnel of the Stranglers would karate-kick for such a ripping, trebly sharpness." (Jack Rabid, Allmusic)
"Pierre Kezdy's bass gurgles blood on one track, and is swampy on the next." (Bob Gendron, Allmusic)
"Pierre Kezdy's bass sounds like a power tool" (Greg Kot, Chicago Tribune)
