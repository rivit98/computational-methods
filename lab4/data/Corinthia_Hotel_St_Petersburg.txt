The Corinthia Hotel St. Petersburg, formerly the Nevskij Palace Hotel (known in Russian as Невский Палас), is a five-star hotel in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It is located on Nevsky Prospect. Corinthia Hotel St Petersburg is regarded as one of Saint Petersburg's most luxurious hotels, along with Hotel Astoria and Grand Hotel Europe.
The Nevskij Palace Hotel featured in the 1996 spy film Midnight in Saint Petersburg starring Michael Caine as Harry Palmer.It recently underwent an enlargement, during which two historical buildings on either side were restored and joined to the complex to serve as a 7,000 square metres (75,000 sq ft) office building, and a 10,000 square metres (110,000 sq ft) trading center. The building project was run by Arup.


== Refurbishment ==
Goddard Littlefair, a London-based interior design studio, is working on a two-phase refurbishment that will seek to raise the hotel's profile and follow on from the success of Corinthia, London, unifying the structures via a modern and luxurious treatment, with light touches of art deco-era inspiration.As part of the refurbishment, the restaurant is being redesigned as an all-day-dining, destination restaurant offer, with an elegant brasserie feel and strong Art Deco references that correlate with the rest of the hotel interior. The design treatment offers segmented and more secluded areas, so that diners in smaller groups could experience a sense of intimacy, set within a typically high-style Corinthia environment.
