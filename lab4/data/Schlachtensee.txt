Schlachtensee (German pronunciation ) is a lake in the south west of Berlin, in the Steglitz-Zehlendorf borough (between the quarters of Nikolassee and Zehlendorf), on the edge of the Grunewald forest. The lake lends its name to the surrounding area and to the nearby Studentendorf Schlachtensee, a student residence. The area has been part of Berlin since 1920.


== Geography and Paul-Ernst Park ==
Schlachtensee is the most southerly in the Grunewald chain of lakes, which belongs geologically to the Teltow plateau, and was emerged some 15,000 years ago from the ice age as a glacial trough. With a surface area of around 421,000 square metres (104 acres), a circumference of 5.5 kilometres and a maximum depth of 8½ metres, it is one of the larger lakes in Berlin. The lake is popularly used for walking and for swimming, due to the good quality of the water.
The Paul-Ernst Park is located next to the S-Bahnhof Schlachtensee. The park is named for the writer, Paul Ernst (1866–1933), and contains a memorial stone. It is open to the public and runs down the slope to the lake and half a kilometer around the southern shore. At the end of the park is a large wooded area, while the area over the S-Bahn station is landscaped into lawns.
