The Potez 36 was a French two-seat touring or sport monoplane designed and built by Potez. The Potez 36 was a high-wing braced monoplane with a conventional landing gear. It had an enclosed cabin with side-by-side seating for a pilot and passenger. The design had some unusual features like folding wings to make it easier to store or to tow behind a motor car. Some of the aircraft had Potez-designed leading-edge slats. The aircraft was popular with both French private owners and flying clubs with a small number being used by the French Air Force during the 1930s as liaison aircraft.
