Multi-Marques Inc. is Quebec's largest bakery and the second largest in Canada since its merger with Canada Bread. Multi-Marques Inc. employs more than 1 700 people throughout seven bakeries in Laval, Beauport, Lévis, Quebec, Montreal and St-Côme-de-Beauce.
Multi-Marques also makes private and national label bread and pastries for many food wholesalers in Quebec. With revenues of more than c$300 million and the growing demand for products in the North American market is a continuing source of motivation.
In December 2001, the Laval bakery (where their head office is located) earned the prestigious HACCP Certification (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point).
Multi-Marques Inc. is a division of Canada Bread Company, a Toronto Stock Exchange-listed company.  The company and its first product line was originally created by Morton Satin, Research Director of Steinberg Foods in Montreal in 1975, as a marketing outlet for the unique line of Steinberg breads.
