Paste magazine critic Mack Hayden stated that the album is "as communal as a set of campfire songs, complete with humor, screw-ups and familiarity."Stuart Berman of Pitchfork noted: "Live at Biko is quick to remind us that Benji is as much a comedy as tragedy, at times forcefully so." PopMatters critic John Paul praised Kozelek's lyrics and storytelling, writing: "Thoroughly exhausting, but highly rewarding, Kozelek’s recent work is some of the most rewarding of his career, Live at Biko proving no exception."
