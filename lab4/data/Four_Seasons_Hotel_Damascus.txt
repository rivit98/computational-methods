It is located in the central district neighborhood of Damascus, Syria. It is located on Shukri Al Quatli Street. The hotel, financed by the Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, was opened in 2005 and completed on time by local contractor the Fouad Takla Company. Four Seasons concluded its management of the hotel effective June 19, 2019, due to US sanctions on its co-owner Samer Foz.
