Hutchinson came to Britain in 1936 when he joined the Earls Court Rangers. However, he had a poor start to his British ice hockey career, giving up 232 goals in forty games. Deciding his future in ice hockey looked bleak, Hutchinson worked as a carpenter at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre. When the goaltender who replaced Hutchinson was injured, he was asked to play again. The following season, 1938–39, Hutchinson was named to the ENL All-star team. An honour he was to receive another four times during his career playing for Streatham, the Wembley Lions and the Brighton Tigers. Whilst with the Tigers, Hutchinson helped them to with the league championship in 1946–47 and 1947–48, and the Autumn Cup in 1946 and 1950.
When Hutchinson retired from playing, he became the stage manager for the Tom Arnold Ice Show at the Brighton Sports Stadium. Later in life, he ran a number of public houses in Sussex before he died on 30 December 1996 at the Mile Oak Inn in Portslade near Brighton.
