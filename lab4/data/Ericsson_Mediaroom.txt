== History ==


=== Microsoft TV platform ===
Microsoft announced an UltimateTV service from DirecTV in October 2000, based on technology acquired from WebTV Networks (later renamed MSN TV).
The software was called the Microsoft TV platform (which included the Foundation Edition); it had integrated digital video recorder (DVR) and Internet  access capabilities. It was released on October 26, 2000. The software to decode and view digital video programming was derived from WebTV (later called MSN TV). UltimateTV had support for picture-in-picture and could record up to 35 hours of video content. The Internet capabilities were provided by Microsoft TV platform software, which was used for the TV guide. The TV guide could display programming schedule for 14 days, and recording could be scheduled for any of the shows. It could also be used to access E-mail. However, Microsoft lost distribution when DirecTV accepted an acquisition bid by Echostar, who had their own DVR. By 2003, it was taken off the market, even though it is still supported by DirecTV and the acquisition by Echostar failed.
The UltimateTV developers in Mountain View, California were eliminated by early 2002.
By June 2002, Moshe Lichtman replaced Jon DeVaan as leader of the division as more reductions were announced.


==== Foundation Edition ====
The Microsoft TV Foundation Edition platform integrated video-on-demand (VOD), DVR and HDTV programming with live television programming. It includes an electronic programming guide (EPG) that could be used to access any supported service from a centralized directory. The EPG could be used to search and filter the listings as well. The EPG was released around 2002. Comcast announced it would adopt this software in May 2004. Microsoft TV Foundation Edition platform also included an authoring environment that could be used to create content consumable from the set top box.
