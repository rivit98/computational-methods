== Themes ==
The central theme of the film is connection and how small moments that seem inconsequential can make a huge difference in a life. And since you don't know what moments can make the difference, there's no point in stressing out about it. Howard says of the theme that "one of the most important aspects is to just live your life regardless of what's happening around you. If you're worried or stressed out about something, it's not going to do any good to shut down and not keep moving on. And whether the situation turns out good or bad, there was still so much wasted time in that interim. It's not how much time you have; it's how you use that time that makes all the difference.

The film had its world premiere on April 8, 2016 at the Vail Film Festival and continued on with a successful film festival run. It garnered more than a dozen award wins and nominations throughout the festival circuit and was picked up for distribution by TurnKey Films in 2017.
