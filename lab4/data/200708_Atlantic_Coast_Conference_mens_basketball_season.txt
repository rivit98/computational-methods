Throughout the conference season, the ACC offices name a player and rookie of the week.  North Carolina's Tyler Hansbrough broke the ACC single-season record for player of the week honors during the 2007–08 season with eight awards.  The record had previously been seven, held by J. J. Redick and Antawn Jamison. The MVP of the ACC Tournament is the automatic winner of the final ACC player of the week of each season.

Tyler Hansbrough was the unanimous choice for ACC player of the year, while Virginia Tech's Seth Greenberg won conference Coach of the Year honors for guiding the Hokies to a fourth-place finish after being picked tenth in the preseason.
