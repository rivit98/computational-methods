"The One That I Love" was the Maltese entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1998, performed in English by Chiara.
The song is a ballad, with Chiara telling her lover how she feels about him. She begins by describing the evening, before confessing that "I think that I'm in love and you mean so much to me" and later becoming more definite, singing that "I'm certain and now I know/For me, yes, you're just the one/The one that I love".
A Maltese language version, titled "Lilek Inħobb" was recorded and also the German singer Melanie Terres covered the song titled "Der Eine für mich".
The song was performed tenth on the night, following Germany's Guildo Horn with "Guildo hat euch lieb!" and preceding Hungary's Charlie with "A holnap már nem lesz szomorú". At the close of voting, it had received 165 points, placing 3rd in a field of 25. This was Malta's best result at the Eurovision Song Contest, as the score was higher than Mary Spiteri's 123 points in 1992 with "Little Child", which had also placed 3rd.
It was succeeded as Maltese representative at the 1999 Contest by Times Three with "Believe 'n Peace".
The song was published as a single by German record label Capsounds, and was also featured in a compilation album with songs performed by various international artists. During the period that Chiara was managed by Massimo Ellul's management firm, the song was also published in two other albums.
