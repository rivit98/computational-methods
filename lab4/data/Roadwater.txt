The mission church and school of St Luke were opened in the 1880s.It has links via its own railway station, with the West Somerset Mineral Railway, which transported iron ore in the 19th century from the Brendon Hills to Watchet on the coast.
More recent history is demonstrated in the restoration of a World War II pillbox.
