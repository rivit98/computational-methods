Martin Peudargent (or Peu d'argent, also Martin von Huy; Huy, c. 1510-1570s) was a Flemish composer and chapel master of William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg in Düsseldorf.Mainly motets survive from Peudargents hand. His motetcollection from 1555 is known as the first music to ever be printed in Düsseldorf. Peudargents musical style is typical for the Flemish school and closely resembles that of composers such as Clemens non Papa, even though Peudargent sticks less to Gregorian modes and strives towards a stronger textual expression.
