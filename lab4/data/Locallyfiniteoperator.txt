In mathematics, a linear operator 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        V
        →
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:V\to V}
   is called locally finite if the space 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
   is the union of a family of finite-dimensional 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  -invariant subspaces.
In other words, there exists a family 
  
    
      
        {
        
          V
          
            i
          
        
        |
        i
        ∈
        I
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{V_{i}\vert i\in I\}}
   of linear subspaces of 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
  ,  such that we have the following:

  
    
      
        
          ⋃
          
            i
            ∈
            I
          
        
        
          V
          
            i
          
        
        =
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bigcup _{i\in I}V_{i}=V}
  

  
    
      
        (
        ∀
        i
        ∈
        I
        )
        f
        [
        
          V
          
            i
          
        
        ]
        ⊆
        
          V
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\forall i\in I)f[V_{i}]\subseteq V_{i}}
  
Each 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{i}}
   is finite-dimensional.

Every linear operator on a finite-dimensional space is trivially locally finite.
Every diagonalizable (i.e. there exists a basis of 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
   whose elements are all eigenvectors of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  ) linear operator is locally finite, because it is the union of subspaces spanned by finitely many eigenvectors of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
