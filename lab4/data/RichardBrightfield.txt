Richard Brightfield (born 1927) is an American writer of children's gamebooks.
He wrote a number of Choose Your Own Adventure books, and was the first author to establish himself within that series after its founders Edward Packard and R.A. Montgomery. Although he is probably best known among collectors of that series for his books on martial arts, his earliest works for that series had quite different subject matter, being focused on various scientific topics or fantasy.
Brightfield resides in Palm Beach County, Florida.
