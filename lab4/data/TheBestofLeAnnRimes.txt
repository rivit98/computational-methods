The Best of LeAnn Rimes is a greatest hits album by American country singer LeAnn Rimes, released in 2004, it tweaks the 2003 US release Greatest Hits, leaving behind some of the purer country hits that did not translate outside of the US—notably, Al Anderson's "Big Deal"—and concentrating on her big pop crossover hits, including "How Do I Live", "Can't Fight the Moonlight" and her duet with Ronan Keating, "Last Thing on My Mind".
