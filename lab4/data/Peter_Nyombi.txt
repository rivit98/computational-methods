He advised Rebecca Kadaga, the Speaker of Parliament, that three MPs expelled by their political party, the National Resistance Movement, could keep their parliamentary seats.
He advised the President, Yoweri Museveni, that it was Constitutional for General Aronda Nyakairima, an actively serving officer in the Uganda People's Defence Force to serve in the Ugandan Cabinet, as Minister of Internal Affairs.
He advised the President that the former Chief Justice of Uganda, Justice Benjamin Odoki, who had attained the mandatory retirement age of 70 years, could continue to serve on the bench beyond the age of 70, as stipulated in the constitution.The society issued Nyombi with a "certificate of incompetence" after a vote by its members during an extraordinary meeting which Nyombi chose not to attend.  The suspension was to have lasted two years but Nyombi successfully fought to have it quashed in the Uganda High Court in December 2014.
