Normalization of deviance is a term used by the American sociologist Diane Vaughan to describe the process in which deviance from normal behavior becomes normalized in a corporate culture.Vaughan defines this as a process where a clearly unsafe practice comes to be considered normal if it does not immediately cause a catastrophe: "a long incubation period [before a final disaster] with early warning signs that were either misinterpreted, ignored or missed completely."The original example cited by Vaughn was the events leading to the Challenger disaster, but the concept has also been applied to clinical practice in medicine and aviation safety.
