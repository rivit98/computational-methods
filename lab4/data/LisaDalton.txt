Lisa Dalton (Lisa Loving) is an American stage and film actor, director, documentary filmmaker, acting coach, and the co-founder of the National Michael Chekhov Association (NMCA), an accredited training program in the Michael Chekhov Acting Technique currently based out of the University of Southern Maine. Lisa is one of the most ardent proponents of the Michael Chekhov Acting Technique as can be seen in her lifelong dedication to sharing her knowledge about Michael Chekhov and his approach to acting.


== Career ==
Lisa's professional career began in New York as one of the founding members of the Bond Street Theatre. Aside from acting, she also performed stunts while in New York, doubling for popular artists like Madonna and Cher,  until she suffered a debilitating back injury in 1989.
Notable film acting credits include ER, Carnivale, Inspector Mom, Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, and Berry Gordy's The Last Dragon. In 2011, she toured a solo performance of Anton Chekhov's The Darling, adapted and directed by Victor S. Tkachenko's, at the New York Fringe Festival after first premiering in Fort Worth, TX at the Pantagleize Theatre.


== Michael Chekhov Acting Technique ==
During her time in New York Lisa trained with Ted Pugh who led her and a small group of actors in an exploration of the Michael Chekhov Acting Technique. These meetings eventually led to Ted's creation of The Actor’s Ensemble, a New York-based theatre company that still operates today. Under Ted's tutelage, Lisa was exposed to the first generation of Chekhov students through Beatrice Straight's Michael Chekhov Studio. It was during these training sessions that Lisa was introduced to Mala Powers, the Chekhov Estate Executrix.
In the late 1980s Lisa moved to Los Angeles and began teaching the Michael Chekhov Technique with Mala Powers. During this time she studied under Michael Chekhov proteges George Shdanoff and Jack Colvin and met future NMCA co-founder, Wil Kilroy, a professor at University of Southern Maine.
In 1993, Mala Powers, Lisa Dalton, and Wil Kilroy presented workshops on the Michael Chekhov Technique at the Association for Theatre in Higher Education (ATHE). This experience led the team to establish a formal association that could provide training in the Michael Chekhov Technique. In 1994 the National Michael Chekhov Association (NMCA) held its first official summer intensive during the University of Southern Maine's Summer Sessions. The program continued to grow in credibility, leading to its full accreditation from the State of Maine educational system for both Graduate and Undergraduate studies.
