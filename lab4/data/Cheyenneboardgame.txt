Cheyenne Game (1958) is a Milton Bradley children's board game for two to four players based on the 1957 Golden Globe Award winning ABC Warner Bros. western television series Cheyenne (1955-1962) starring Clint Walker. A second edition of the game was released during Clint Walker's dispute with Warner Bros. that featured Bronco star Ty Hardin on the box cover. A typical track/racing board game, Cheyenne was one of many board games published during the 1950s based on television programs. 
In addition to the standard center-seamed, illustrated game board, a spinner, and four tokens of various colors, the game includes four plastic "revolvers", four plastic "bullets", and six small cardboard obstacles such as a rattlesnake and bandit. 


== Gameplay ==
Each player moves in turn along the track in accordance with his spin on the dial. The player must stop and "shoot" an obstacle when they reaches a space with a gun on it, even if their spin would have carried them beyond the gun space. The player sets the obstacle up on its corresponding illustration (Rattlesnake on the snake picture, for example) and removes all other counters from the game board. The player places one of the plastic disks ("bullets") on the orange circle in the lower left hand corner of the game board, then, similarly to Tiddlywinks, uses their plastic revolver to "shoot" the disk at the obstacle. The player must move or knock over the obstacle with the disk in order to advance on the track. Each player must shoot all six obstacles before entering the Pony Express Station at the end of the track. The game is won when one player defeats all six obstacles on the game board and enters the Express Station via an exact spin.
