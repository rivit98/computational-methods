Yorick is an interpreted programming language designed for numerics, graph plotting, and steering large scientific simulation codes. It is quite fast due to array syntax, and extensible via C or Fortran routines. It was created in 1996 by David H. Munro of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

=== Indexing ===
Yorick is good at manipulating elements in N-dimensional arrays conveniently with its powerful syntax.
Several elements can be accessed all at once:

Arbitrary elements
Pseudo-indexLike "theading" in PDL and "broadcasting" in Numpy, Yorick has a mechanism to do this:

Rubber index".." is  a rubber-index to represent zero or more dimensions of the array.

"*" is a kind of rubber-index to reshape a slice(sub-array) of array to a vector.

Tensor multiplicationTensor multiplication is done as follows in Yorick:

P(,+, )*Q(, +)

          âˆ‘
          
            j
            =
            1
          
          
            j
            =
            N
          
        
        
          
            P
            
              i
              j
              k
              l
            
          
          
            Q
            
              m
              n
              j
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{j=N}{P_{ijkl}Q_{mnj}}}
