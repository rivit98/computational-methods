Kazansky railway terminal (Russian: Каза́нский вокза́л, Kazansky vokzal) also known as Moscow Kazansky railway station (Russian: Москва́-Каза́нская, Moskva-Kazanskaya) is one of nine railway terminals in Moscow, situated on the Komsomolskaya Square, across the square from the Leningradsky and Yaroslavsky stations.
Kazansky station primarily serves two major railway lines radiating from Moscow: the eastbound one, to Kazan, Yekaterinburg, and points beyond (one of the routes of the Trans-Siberian Railway), and the south-east-bound one, to Ryazan. After Ryazan, the south-eastern line branches a number of times, so that trains originating from Kazansky station serve most of south-eastern Russia, Kazakhstan, and the post-Soviet Central Asian states (mostly via the Trans-Aral line). Commuter trains serving these two directions use Kazansky station as well.
Occasionally, long-distance trains serving the eastbound Moscow-Nizhny Novgorod line use Kazansky station as well. However, the commuter trains of that line never do so, as they always arrive to Moscow's Kursky Rail Terminal.
Construction of the modern building according to the design by architect Alexey Shchusev started in 1913 and ended in 1940. The building resembles the Söyembikä Tower in Kazan.
