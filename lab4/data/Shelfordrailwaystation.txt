== History ==
The station was opened by the Eastern Counties Railway in 1845 and later became a junction with the opening of the Stour Valley Railway from Haverhill on 1 June 1865.  The subsequent completion of the line onwards to Sudbury a few months later created a through link with Colchester on the Great Eastern Main Line.  This was used by through holiday trains between Clacton-on-Sea and the East/West Midlands in LNER and British Rail days but then fell victim to the Beeching Axe, closing to all traffic on 6 March 1967.Eminent theatre director Sir Peter Hall lived here in his early life when his father Reginald Hall was the stationmaster.
