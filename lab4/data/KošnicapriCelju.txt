Košnica pri Celju is the site of three known mass graves from the period immediately after the Second World War. All three graves are located south of the road from Košnica pri Celju to Liboje, south of the house at Košnica pri Celju no. 13, in a meadow alongside Košnica Creek (Slovene: Košniški potok). They contain the remains of ethnically Slovene and German residents of Celje that were murdered between May and July 1945. Field investigations of the graves were carried out in July 2010. Mass Grave 1 (Grobišče 1), also known as the Women's Mass Grave (Grobišče "ženski grob"), contains the remains of 400 to 600 victims.
