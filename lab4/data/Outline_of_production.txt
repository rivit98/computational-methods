The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to production:
Production – act of creating 'use' value or 'utility' that can satisfy a want or need. The act may or may not include factors of production other than labor.  Any effort directed toward the realization of a desired product or service is a "productive" effort and the performance of such act is production.
The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to production:


== Types ==
Industry – production of an economic good or service within an economy.  Industry is divided into four sectors, or types of production; they are:


=== Primary sector ===
Primary sector – this involves the extraction of resources directly from the Earth, this includes agricultural and resource extraction industries. In these industries, the product (that is, the focus of production) is a natural resource.
Agriculture   (outline) – cultivation of animals, plants, fungi, and other life forms for food, fiber, and other products used to sustain life.Animal husbandry – agricultural practice of breeding and raising livestock.
Farming – cultivating land for the purpose of agricultural production.
Aquaculture – the farming of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic plants, algae, and other aquatic organisms.
Forestry   (outline) – creating, managing, using, and conserving forests and associated resources in a sustainable manner to meet desired goals, needs, and values for human benefit.
Resource extraction –
Fishing – activity of catching or harvesting fish and other aquatic animals such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms.
Logging – harvesting timber, including cutting, skidding, on-site processing, and loading trees or logs onto trucks or skeleton cars.
Mining   (outline) – extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth, from an ore body, vein or (coal) seam.
Extraction of petroleum – process by which usable petroleum (oil) is extracted and removed from the earth.
Extraction of natural gas – Natural gas is commercially extracted from oil fields and natural gas fields.
Water industry – provides drinking water to residential, commercial, and industrial sectors of the economy.


=== Secondary sector ===
Secondary sector – involves the processing of raw materials from primary industries, and includes the industries that produce a finished, tangible product.
Construction – process that consists of the building or assembling of infrastructure, including buildings, roads, dams, etc.
Manufacturing – process which involves tools and labor to produce goods for use or sale. Ranges from handicraft to high tech industrial production.


=== Tertiary sector ===
Tertiary sector – This group is involved in the provision of services. They include teachers, managers and other service providers.


=== Quaternary sector ===
Quaternary sector – the part of the economy that produces knowledge-based services.Information industry –
Information generation and sharing –
Information technology –
Consulting services –
Education –
Research and development –
Financial planning services –
