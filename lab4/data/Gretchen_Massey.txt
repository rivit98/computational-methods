She was the host of the CBS Big Brother show House Calls: The Big Brother Talk Show that  was broadcast weekdays on cbs.com, when Big Brother USA is in season.

Due to Marcellas being part of season 7's All-Stars, Gretchen was the sole host. Many assumed Marcellas would return to his co-hosting duties, but due to budget cuts he did not return to House Calls for its fourth season (aired during Big Brother 8). House Calls was canceled after season 10.
