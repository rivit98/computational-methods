Rosario has published in English, French, and Spanish, and his books include Science and Homosexualities and The Erotic Imagination: French Histories of Perversity. He has been a longtime activist in eliminating homophobia, and he has criticized author J. Michael Baileyâ€™s stereotypic depiction of gay men in The Man Who Would Be Queen.
