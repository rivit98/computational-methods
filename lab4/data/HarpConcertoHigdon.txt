== Reception ==
Reviewing the world premiere, Daniel J. Kushner of City Newspaper praised the concerto, writing, "What started out as a somewhat muted affair quickly became a sweeping scape with symphonic tendencies. Higdon was keen to showcase the harp's naturally rich harmonic colors, and there was something prayerful about Kondonassis's playing, particularly in the quieter moments."  Reviewing a recording of the work, Tal Agam of The Classic Review similarly described it as "an exciting and truly original new piece, that can certainly enjoy success with the public."In 2020, Higdon won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Classical Composition for her composition of the piece. Kondonassis was nominated for her performance of the concerto with Ward Stare and the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, but did not win.


== Recording ==
The world premiere recording of the Harp Concerto was released on the album "American Rapture" through Azica Records on May 17, 2019.
