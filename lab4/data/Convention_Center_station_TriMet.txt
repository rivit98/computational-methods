Convention Center station is a light rail station on the MAX Blue, Green and Red Lines in Portland, Oregon. It is the 8th stop eastbound on the current Eastside MAX, having not been built when the original line opened, in 1986.  It was built to serve the Oregon Convention Center, which did not exist when the MAX line opened, and was completed and opened in the same month as the Convention Center, September 1990.The station is located on Northeast Holladay Street at its intersection with Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.  Although the station primarily serves the Oregon Convention Center, and the main entry to that building faces the light rail station, there are also a number of hotels immediately east and also north of the station.
From 2001 to 2012, this station was located within Fareless Square (renamed the Free Rail Zone in 2010), but the free-ride zone was discontinued in September 2012.
