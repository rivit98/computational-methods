== Music video ==
The video introduced a new image for Sheila E., dressed in a brocaded "cloud jacket" that harkened back to Prince's "cloud suit" from his contemporaneously (1985) released video "Raspeberry Beret".  At the timestamp of 3:06 within the video, an image of Prince from "Raspberry Beret" is superimposed for one second over a newspaper graphic with the headline "WHO IS SHEILA E.'S MYSTERY LOVE?"


== Chart performance ==
The song stalled on the charts and went no higher than #36 on the R&B charts, and did not chart on the Hot 100. Its greatest chart position was when it peaked at #8 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. Because of the under performance of "Sister Fate", the second single, "A Love Bizarre" (a duet with mentor Prince) was rush released.
