== Plot ==
Samundi (R. Sarathkumar), his mother (Varalakshmi) and his little sister Lakshmi (Sangita) move into their new house in a little village. Ponnuthayi (Kanaka), a washerwoman, sympathizes with Samundi's family and she eventually falls in love with Samundi. Rajangam (Mansoor Ali Khan) and his brother (Uday Prakash) spread terror among the villagers. One day, the ringing of temple bells and the heralding of the festival throws Samundi into an uncontrollable fit of rage. Ponnuthayi asks the reason for his rage and Samundi tells her about his tragic past.
In the past, Samundi prepared his sister Rasathi's wedding and he took her to the temple. There, he clashed with some thugs. In the confrontation, Rasathi was pushed into the lake and drowned. The wedding was cancelled and Samundi's family left his village.
Samundi cannot tolerate anymore the oppression of Rajangam's henchmen so he beats them. The villagers then acclaim Samundi, and Rajangam feels ridiculed. At Samundi's wedding, a police officer, who is under Rajangam's order, arrests the innocent Samundi. Samundi is then released after the villagers' pressure. The angry Samundi enters in Rajangam's house with a machete and to his surprise, he finds his sister Rasathi alive and wearing a white saree (widow's clothes). What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
