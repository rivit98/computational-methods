Thomas Jeeves Horder, 1st Baron Horder,  (7 January 1871 – 13 August 1955) was an English physician recognised as a leading clinician and diagnostician of his day.


== Biography ==


=== Early life and education ===

Thomas Jeeves Horder was born on 7 January 1871, the son of draper Albert Horder, in Shaftesbury, Dorset. Jeeves was his mother's maiden name. He was educated privately, and at the University of London and St Bartholomew's Hospital, London.


=== Career ===
Horder began his career at St Bartholomew's Hospital and, when still quite young, successfully made a difficult diagnosis on King Edward VII which made his reputation. His patients included every British monarch from Edward VII to Elizabeth II (except Edward VIII). They also included two prime ministers, Ramsay MacDonald and Bonar Law, and labour leader Hugh Gaitskell.
He was involved in many official committees including advising the Ministry of Food during World War II. After the war he opposed many of Aneurin Bevan's plans for a national health service and may have helped modify some of those less palatable to the medical profession.
He held the positions of Deputy Lieutenant County of Hampshire; Extra Physician to the Queen (formerly Extra Physician to King George VI); and Consulting Physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital (1912–1936). Knighted in 1918, he was created a Baronet in 1923. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Horder, of Ashford in the County of Southampton on 23 January 1933.Horder served as president of the British Eugenics Society from 1935 to 1949 and as president of the Cremation Society of Great Britain from 1940 to his death in 1955.
He was President of The Peckham Experiment in 1949.


=== Marriage and children ===
In 1902 Horder married Geraldine Rose Doggett (1872–1954), of Newnham Manor, Hertfordshire, whose maternal grandfather was James Smith Rose of Arley House, Bristol, who in 1873 was the Mayor of Totnes. Their son was the publisher Mervyn Horder (1910–1997). Their daughter Joy Horder married Edward Cullinan, chief physician at St Bartholomew's Hospital; their son was British architect Edward Cullinan.


=== Death and afterward ===
He lived for many years at Steep near Petersfield, Hampshire, where he died on 13 August 1955.
