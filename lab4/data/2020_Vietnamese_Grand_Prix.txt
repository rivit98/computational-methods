The 2020 Vietnamese Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 VinFast Vietnam Grand Prix 2020) is a Formula One motor race that is due to be held in Hanoi, Vietnam. The race is to be contested at the Hanoi Street Circuit as part of the 2020 Formula One World Championship. The race is due be the first running of the Vietnamese Grand Prix and one of two new events to join the Formula One calendar in 2020, the other being the revived Dutch Grand Prix. The race was indefinitely postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


== Background ==


=== Preparations ===
Plans for a race in Vietnam were first explored by former Formula One CEO Bernie Ecclestone, who ultimately abandoned the idea after the failure of the Korean and Indian Grands Prix. The idea of a race in Vietnam was revived after Liberty Media purchased the commercial rights to the sport from CVC Capital Partners in January 2017. The Vietnamese Grand Prix was announced in November 2018, becoming the first new race under Liberty Media's ownership.The Vietnamese Grand Prix was officially confirmed as the fourth round of twenty-two races of the 2020 Formula One World Championship at an FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Paris in December 2019.


=== Impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus ===
The early season was affected by the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, which led to concerns being raised about the Vietnamese Grand Prix when several people tested positive for the disease in villages close to Hanoi. The Chinese Grand Prix was postponed as part of the sport's initial response, and Ross Brawn—the sport's managing director—stated that the sport was working with Vietnamese authorities to monitor the outbreak and that he expected the race to go ahead. This view was shared by current Formula One Group CEO Chase Carey. The Australian Grand Prix was cancelled after the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic, prompting the sport to reassess several rounds of the championship. The Grand Prix was subsequrently postponed indefinitely.
