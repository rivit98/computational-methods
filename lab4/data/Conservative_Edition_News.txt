Conservative Edition News (along with its sister website  Liberal Edition News) is one of a pair of controversial websites controlled by Ken LaCorte, a former Fox News executive. The new websites are written, according to the New York Times investigation, by a network of authors in Macedonia,  previous known for publishing disinformation during the 2016 US presidential election. The Times reports that  Conservative Edition News contains content "guaranteed to infuriate the American right," while Liberal Edition News contains stories "guaranteed to drive liberal voters further left or to wring a visceral response from moderates. "   LaCorte said that the purpose of the sites was to drive traffic to his principal venture LaCorte News, a “centrist-right” website that he brands as a “digital news start-up with the stated goal of restoring faith in the media.”
