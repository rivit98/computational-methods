The South Burnett Region is a local government area in the South Burnett district of Queensland, Australia.


== Origins ==
This Local Government was created in March 2008 as a result of the report of the Local Government Reform Commission released in July 2007.
Prior to the 2008 amalgamation, the South Burnett Region, located in the southern catchment of the Burnett River, existed as four distinct local government areas:

the Shire of Kingaroy;
the Shire of Nanango;
the Shire of Murgon;
and the Shire of Wondai.The report recommended the new local government area should not be divided into wards and should elect six councilors and a mayor however the Interim Steering Committee applied to the State Government for four wards based on the old shire boundaries. As the total population is just a few hundred short of the level set in the report for eight councilors and a mayor, application for this was also made.


== Area and size ==
The South Burnett Region covers an area 8,382 square kilometres (3,236 sq mi), containing a population of 32,555 in June 2018 and has an estimated operating budget of A$42 m (as at 2008).
The Aboriginal community of Cherbourg has been excluded from the amalgamated area and continues to have its own local government.
