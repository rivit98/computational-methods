Raymond Duch is an Official Fellow at Nuffield College, University of Oxford, and Director of the Nuffield Centre of Experimental Social Sciences (CESS), which has centres in Oxford, Santiago (Chile) and Pune (India). He is also currently the Long Term Visiting Professor at the Institute for Advanced Studies at the Toulouse School of Economics. Professor Duch has served as Associate Editor of the American Journal of Political Science and the Journal of Experimental Political Science. In 2015, Professor Duch was selected as a member of the UK Cabinet Office Cross-Whitehall Trial Advice Panel to offer Whitehall departments technical support in designing and implementing controlled experiments to assess policy effectiveness.
Professor Duch's research focuses on responsibility attribution, incorporating elements of theory, experiments and analysis of public opinion. In 2008 he published an award-winning book, The  Economic  Vote, that demonstrates that citizens hold political parties accountable for economic outcomes. More recently Professor Duch has turned to experiments in order to identify the information shortcuts that individuals deploy for attributing responsibility for collective decision making. Duch is associate editor of the Journal of Experimental Political Science and the American Journal of Political Science since 2012.
