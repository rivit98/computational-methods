McNally has received praise from former manager Sir Alex Ferguson and United players for his treatment of injuries at the club, including managing Rio Ferdinand's back problems and Darren Fletcher's illness.McNally has found himself at the centre of disputes between Manchester United and the England national football team over the treatment of injuries, and United being unhappy with the England set-up publicly releasing details of player injuries. His staff were also involved in a public argument over the treatment of injuries suffered by Owen Hargreaves, who appeared to criticise United's medical team after departing the club in 2011. United strongly backed their medical staff, and considered taking legal action against Hargreaves.
