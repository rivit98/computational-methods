The highway follows the original routing of US 87 through the city of Plainview. When the new US 87 freeway was built to the west, this segment was redesignated as Loop 445, the Plainview Loop, on January 31, 1967, and marked as BUS US 87. On June 21, 1990, Loop 445 was renamed Business I-27.


== Route description ==
Business I-27 leaves I-27 south of Plainview at exit 45 and heads northeast towards the city. The highway begins as a four-lane road, with a wide median dividing the two directions. The road passes through several miles of farmland, before entering Plainview, and passing the Hale County Jail. The roadway continues past a small elementary school, several residential streets, the Hale County Airport, and an auto junkyard, before intersecting with U.S. Route 70, in downtown Plaiview. The highway continues through downtown, intersecting several city blocks, and passing several parks and businesses. In the northern section of downtown, the road passes a small railroad depot, and a set of railroad tracks come alongside the eastbound lanes of the highway. The highway continues north from there, passing several more residential streets, before intersecting Interstate 27 in the northern region of Plainview. This intersection is the highway's northern terminus.
