ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ARL2 gene.


== Function ==
The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) genes are small GTP-binding proteins of the RAS superfamily.  ARL2 is a member of a functionally distinct group of ARF-like genes.


== Interactions ==
ARL2 has been shown to interact with Protein unc-119 homolog, TBCD and PDE6D.
