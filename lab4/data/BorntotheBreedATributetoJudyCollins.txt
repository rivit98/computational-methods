Born to the Breed: A Tribute to Judy Collins  is a tribute compilation album to American folk singer Judy Collins, released on October 14, 2008 in the United States by the record label, Wildflower. A portion of the proceeds earned from album sales went to the Jazz Foundation of America.The album developed from a discussion between Collins and Chrissie Hynde, longtime fans of each other. Collins recalled to an interviewer: "She told me she had a top-10 list of songs by other people that she wanted to record. One of them was one of my songs, 'My Father.' So I said, 'Well, why don't you do it? It would be great!'".
