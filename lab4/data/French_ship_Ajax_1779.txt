Ajax was a 64-gun ship of the line of the French Navy.


== Career ==
Built as Maréchal de Broglie for private owners and transferred to the French East India Company, the ship sailed two journeys to China as a merchantman. In April 1779, she was purchased by the Crown to ferry furnitures to Isle de France (now Mauritius) and be commissioned as a warship upon her arrival. In June, she was coppered, and she received her name of Ajax on 13 August.On 16 February 1780, Ajax departed Lorient with Protée, Éléphant and Charmante, escorting a convoy bound for India. In late February, off Spain, the convoy met Rodney's fleet; Protée sacrificed herself to hold the British back and was captured on 24, while Charmante returned to Lorient, arriving on 3 March, and the convoy escaped under the protection of Ajax.Arrived at Isle the France, Ajax joined Suffren's squadron. She took part in the Battle of Negapatam in 1782, under Captain Bouvet. The rigging of Ajax having been damaged by a gale the night before and not been repaired, Bouvet requested authorisation to retreat to effect his repairs; when Suffren refused, Ajax remained with her squadron but without taking part in the action. Suffren was furious and cashiered Bouvet for his conduct.Ajax then took part in the Battle of Trincomalee and in the Battle of Cuddalore, under Captain Dupas de la Mancelière, who was killed in the action.
