L'Haÿ-les-Roses owes the second part of its name to a famous rose garden located there.


== Name ==
The commune of L'Haÿ-les-Roses was originally called simply L'Haÿ. The name was recorded for the first time in a charter of Charlemagne in 798 as Laiacum, sometimes also spelt Lagiacum, meaning "estate of Lagius", a Gallo-Roman landowner. The name was later corrupted into Lay, Lahy, and eventually L'Haÿ.
In May 1914 the name of the commune became officially L'Haÿ-les-Roses (meaning "L'Haÿ the roses") in honour of Roseraie du Val-de-Marne, the renowned rose garden created in 1899 by Jules Gravereaux, one of the founders of the Bon Marché department store in Paris.
It is one of the very few French communes with a ÿ in its name.
