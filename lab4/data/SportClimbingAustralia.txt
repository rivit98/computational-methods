Sport Climbing Australia is the governing body for the sport of lead climbing, speed climbing, and bouldering in Australia.


== History ==
The body was founded in 2004 as an amalgamation of the Australian Sport Climbing Federation and the Australian Climbing Gyms Association.  Both bodies had previously designated themselves as the National Sport Organisation for sport climbing in Australia, without any official recognition.  As the Australian Sports Commission requires sports to have a single governing body to be officially recognised, the two bodies put their differences aside in the greater interests of the sport.


== Structure ==
The national body has currently four state member associations: Sport Climbing Victoria, Sport Climbing Queensland, Sport Climbing Tasmania and Sport Climbing NSW/ACT. 
Competition Sport Climbing South Australia and Sport Climbing Western Australia are pending membership.
