Coreopsis gigantea  with the common name giant coreopsis, is a woody perennial plant native to coastal regions of central and southern California and also to northern  Baja California.


== Distribution ==
The plant is found in California coastal sage and chaparral habitats, from 45–180 feet (14–55 m) in elevation. It is found in coastal dunes, chaparral hillsides, and exposed sea bluff habitats.It is distributed on the coasts of: Southern California and the Channel Islands; the Central Coast region; San Francisco Bay Area; and in Mexico on the northwestern Baja California Peninsula and Guadalupe Island.It is restricted to nearly frost-free habitats because its stem is succulent, being cold tolerant to around 25 degrees F. Storing water in this way makes the plants tolerant to drought but especially susceptible to frost.


== Description ==
The stem of Coreopsis gigantea is a trunk up to 1 metre (3.3 ft) tall, and 4–10 centimetres (1.6–3.9 in) in diameter. The plant can reach 4 feet (1.2 m) high by 2 feet (0.61 m) wide. It is summer deciduous, leaving a sculptural bare trunk and branches during the dry season.
Bright green leaves and flowers are on the top of the trunk, the rest of the trunk is bare.
The numerous flowers are yellow, daisy-like, 6–20 cm in diameter. It blooms in the spring and early summer.


== Cultivation ==
Giant Coreopsis is cultivated as an ornamental plant by specialty nurseries. It is planted in native plant, drought tolerant, and wildlife gardens, and in natural landscaping and habitat restoration projects.The plant is very drought tolerant, needs good drainage and is not tolerant of excess moisture, and needs minimal watering during the summer.
