== Community system ==
Since 2003, Hope High School has been partitioned into three semi-independent "communities" -- Hope High School Arts Community, Hope High School Technology Community, and Hope Leadership Communityâ€”each with its own principal. Since June 2009, however, the Leadership Community no longer exists. As of June, 2012, the Arts and Technology communities were merged into one schoolThe triune system was developed in an attempt to remedy a history of exceptionally low test scores (2008 SAT combined score was 1047, over 900 points lower than Moses Brown School, a private school 2 blocks away) at Hope High School.  Many regard Hope High - and the future success or failure of these reforms - as a "litmus test" for educational reform in Rhode Island.It serves grades 8-12 with a total of 1459 students.
The Providence Public School District is attempting to force Hope onto a standardized six-period schedule, which would take away many of the reforms - longer classes, an extended advisory system, the arts and tech programs, and extensive common planning time - that have helped turn the school around.  Students from Hope have been vocal in their protest, rallying at School Board meetings and engaging in a walkout. A group of students declared they are filing a legal challenge against the district's decision on the grounds that it directly violates a state regulation forbidding schools in Rhode Island from decreasing their common planning time.
