Myths and Hymns (originally known as Saturn Returns) is a song cycle by composer Adam Guettel, based on Greek myth and lyrics found in an antique hymnal.Myths and Hymns was first performed Off-Broadway, under the title Saturn Returns, at the Public Theater on March 31, 1998 and closed on April 26, 1998 after 16 performances. It was directed by Tina Landau with a cast of 6 performers that included Annie Golden, Vivian Cherry, Theresa McCarthy, Lawrence Clayton, Jose Llana and Bob Stillman.  Myths and Hymns is structured as a revue, with no through plot. Performed in concert format, it concerns the relationship of humans to gods, past and present.  The songs range from electronic jazz and piano ballad to gospel and musical theater.
Myths and Hymns received its first narrative treatment, written and directed by Elizabeth Lucas (Clear Blue Tuesday), in February 2012 at Prospect Theater in New York City [1]. This marks the first production of the show in New York since its premiere at the Public and the first ever in New York under the current title.
