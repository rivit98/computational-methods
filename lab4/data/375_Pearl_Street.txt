375 Pearl Street, also known as Intergate.Manhattan, the Verizon Building, and One Brooklyn Bridge Plaza, is a 32-story telephone switching building in Civic Center. Lower Manhattan, New York City, at the Manhattan end of the Brooklyn Bridge.
The building originally appeared windowless but had several 3-foot-wide slits (0.91 m) (some with glass) running up the building. Verizon operations include a small DMS-100 switching system and a Switching Control Center System.  The building's CLLI code, its identification in the telecommunications industry, is NYCMNYPS. In 2016, the building underwent a renovation.


== History ==

The building was built for the New York Telephone Company and was completed in 1976. As it approached completion, The New York Times architecture critic Paul Goldberger decried it as the "most disturbing" of the phone company's new switching centers because it "overwhelms the Brooklyn Bridge towers, thrusts a residential neighborhood into shadow and sets a tone of utter banality."


=== 2000s ===
The building played an important part in recovering service to the New York City Police Department following the September 11, 2001 attacks.
Prior to May 2002, the building featured the logo of New York Telephone and Bell Atlantic, but that month, that sign was removed and replaced with the logo of Verizon, which is still there today.In September 2007 it was announced that Taconic Investment Partners purchased the building from Verizon. Verizon leased back floors 8 through 10.  Taconic bought the 1.098-million-square-foot building (102,000 m2) for $172.05 million, which amounted to $185 a foot when property was selling in Manhattan for $500 a foot. Other appeals of the building are its 16- to 17-foot (5.2 m) ceilings and 39,000-square-foot (3,600 m2) floor plans as well as the naming rights.Taconic had announced plans to dramatically change in the facade in which a curtain wall designed by Cookfox is to be built. The New York Times wrote:

Paul E. Pariser, co-chief executive of Taconic, said a reporter had told him: 'Mr. Pariser, you have a challenge cut out for you — turning a G.E. dishwasher into an office building.' I like that challenge.


=== 2010s ===
In early June 2011, Sabey Data Center Properties, the largest privately held developer, owner, and operator of data centers in the United States purchased the deed in lieu of foreclosure from M&T Bank for $120 million, considerably less than what Taconic had paid a few years earlier. Sabey intends to redevelop the property as a major Manhattan data center and technology building. The building is now referred to as  Intergate.Manhattan.John Sabey, president of the company, said they were excited to be part of lower Manhattan's "ascendance as a world capital for data-based enterprises of all types." He said Intergate.Manhattan would appeal to "new scientific, academic and medical research centers" in addition to data center tenants.
"The largest areas of growth for data centers are in the financial, internet-based service and networking, insurance, and healthcare sectors, particularly in life sciences research," said Sabey. "Mission critical computing in these areas demands varying levels of availability and latency sensitivities. Indeed, the most infinitesimal delay in a single computer operation can be harmful. For these enterprises and for multi-national companies originating in Europe and looking to establish a North American data center location, New York is typically a prime choice." On April 3, 2012, the UK's online version of the Daily Telegraph showed 375 Pearl Street ranked 20th in a series of "the ugliest buildings in the world".In late 2016, the building was renovated. The limestone walls on the top 15 stories were removed and replaced with plate glass panels to improve the building's aesthetics and attract traditional office tenants.


== Tenants ==
The building was traditionally home primarily to telecommunications tenants, but following the renovations has attracted numerous traditional office users. The New York City government occupies a significant area of the building including the NYPD with 106,000 square feet (9,800 m2) on the 15th through 17th floors, the Human Resources Administration with 194,000 square feet (18,000 m2), the Department of Finance with 175,000 square feet (16,300 m2), and the Department of Sanitation with 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2).Following the renovation, Rafael Viñoly Architects signed a 20-year, 36,550 square feet (3,396 m2) lease for the 31st floor of the building in July 2018.
