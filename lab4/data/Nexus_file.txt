The NEXUS file format (usually .nex or .nxs) is widely used in bioinformatics. Several popular phylogenetic programs such as PAUP*, MrBayes, Mesquite,, MacClade and SplitsTree use this format.


== Syntax ==
Command inside square brackets [ and ] are ignored (comment). Each block starts with BEGIN block_name; and finishes with END;An example for a simple DNA alignment would be:

 #NEXUS
 Begin data;
 Dimensions ntax=4 nchar=15;
 Format datatype=dna missing=? gap=-;
 Matrix
 Species1   {{DNA sequence|atgctagctagctcg}}
 Species2   {{DNA sequence|atgcta??tag-tag}}
 Species3   {{DNA sequence|atgttagctag-tgg}}
 Species4   {{DNA sequence|atgttagctag-tag}}           
 ;
 End;


=== Basic blocks ===
TAXA block 
The TAXA block contains information about taxa.
DATA block 
The DATA block contains the data matrix (e.g. sequence alignment).
TREES block 
The TREES block contains phylogenetic trees described using the Newick format, e.g. ((A,B),C);: #NEXUS
 BEGIN TAXA;
   TAXLABELS A B C;
 END;
 
 BEGIN TREES;
   TREE tree1 = ((A,B),C);
 END;
