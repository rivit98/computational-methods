Nipawin was a provincial electoral district  for the Legislative Assembly of the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. This district was created before the 9th Saskatchewan general election in 1938 as "Torch River", after the rural municipality and the river that flows through it. Redrawn and renamed "Nipawin" in 1952, the constituency was dissolved before the 23rd Saskatchewan general election in 1995.
It is now part of the constituencies of Carrot River Valley and Saskatchewan Rivers.
