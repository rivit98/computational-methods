== History ==
The emigration of Robert Logan (Senior) with the skills he had learnt boatbuilding on the Clyde encouraged the adoption of frameless diagonally planked two and three-skinned yachts in New Zealand. When combined with the use of the locally grown kauri Agathis australis the resulting hulls were extraordinarily long-lived, being highly resistant to rot and damage.
Logan's firm and his son's Archibald Logan, Robert Logan (Junior) and John Logan's own separate boatbuilding firm of Logan Brothers together with the Bailey boatbuilding family were to dominant yacht building in New Zealand from 1880 to the 1930s.
