"The Rapper" is a song by The Jaggerz, written by band member Dominic Ierace, better known as Donnie Iris. Released as a single, it reached No. 2 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart, behind Simon & Garfunkel's smash "Bridge Over Troubled Water" and it was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1970 (see 1970 in music) for selling over a million copies. (Iris later launched a solo career; his biggest such hit was "Ah! Leah!")
The song is addressed to a girl, or girls in general; it describes the method of a man who seduces women with untruths ("rapping".) The singer says, "You know what he's after"; he concludes by saying there comes a point at which the man has his target where he wants her.  The girl has to "face reality."  The record ends with a small group of applause heard in the studio.
The "rapper" of the title and "rappin'" in the lyrics have only some coincidental resemblance to the vocal style of rapping.
