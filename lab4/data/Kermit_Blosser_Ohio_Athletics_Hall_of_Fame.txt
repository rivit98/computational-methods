The Kermit Blosser Ohio Athletics Hall of Fame is the shrine which all Ohio University Bobcats greats aspire to enter. Since 1965, inductees to the Blosser Ohio Athletics Hall of Fame are inducted during banquet ceremonies the evening prior to a designated home football game. Inductees are also recognized during a special halftime ceremony at the football game the following day. Inductees are also honored into perpetuity as their portrait and accomplishments are displayed in the Ohio Athletics Hall of Fame currently located in the Convocation Center.
Beginning with the class of 2000, the Ohio Athletics Hall of Fame will receive at least three and no more than five new inductees.
