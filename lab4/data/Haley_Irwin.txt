University of Minnesota Duluth women's hockey coach and former Canadian Olympic coach Shannon Miller recruited Irwin for UMD. When Irwin arrived in the fall of 2007 for her first season with the Bulldogs, she came in with more of an offensive game. She was not killing penalties and there were issues with her off-ice training and her weight. Miller made her fill out training logs, journaling all her workouts and her meals.For the 2007–08 season, Irwin led UMD and the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) in scoring, was the league's Rookie of the Year and had the most points per game of any female U.S. college hockey player. For her effort, she was named WCHA Rookie of the Year and to the WCHA First All-Star, WCHA All-Rookie and WCHA All-Tournament teams.
She scored the game-winning goal to help UMD win the 2008 NCAA Division I national championship. The goal was vs. University of Wisconsin goaltender and Patty Kazmaier Award winner Jessie Vetter. At UMD, Irwin benefitted from two Olympic hockey players who were assistant coaches: Canada's Caroline Ouellette and Team USA's Julie Chu.
During a second season at UMD, Irwin scored 22 goals and 44 points in 39 games as the Bulldogs advanced to another NCAA Frozen Four tournament. She was named to the All-WCHA Team, ranked third in UMD scoring and second in goals scored. Irwin led all Bulldog sophomores in goals, points and power play goals.
On December 3 and 4, 2010, Haley Irwin had a hand in every one of her teams’ seven goals versus St. Cloud State. For her efforts, she was recognized as the WCHA Offensive Player of the Week for December 7, 2010. In both games against the Huskies, she had a total of three goals and four assists. She notched two assists, 12 shots on net and was +2 in a 2–2 tie on December 3. The following day, Irwin posted an assist on the first goal (which was also the game-winning goal) before she scored three straight goals and had a natural hat-trick. The hat-trick was Irwin's third of the season and was followed with an assist on the Bulldogs' fifth goal. Irwin recorded ten shots and was +2 in the game. At the conclusion of the series, Irwin became the WCHA leader in scoring and ranked No. 2 in the NCAA with a point per game average of 2.29 (32 points: 17 goals, 15 assists in 14 games).On September 7, 2011, it was announced that Irwin was appointed one of two team captains for the 2011–12 Minnesota–Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey season. In a 7–1 victory over MSU-Mankato on February 18, 2012, Irwin netted the 200th point of her NCAA career. She became the sixth Bulldog to score 200 career points as she registered a power play goal in the first period.
