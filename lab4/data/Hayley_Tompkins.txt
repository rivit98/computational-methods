== Career ==
Tompkins primarily works in small-format watercolour painting and lo-fi sculptures. She created a series of works she called Metabuilts. These ready-mades are often painted and assembled together. They occasionally include found photographs or fragments of photographs. Tompkins has said that she looks "to create an atmosphere, or a blurring of meaning surrounding the objects".With items as simple as a chairs lined up along the floor or as complicated as an image full of blotched colors, Tompkins gets her point across by allowing the viewer to get to whatever conclusion or "wall plug" that they find. Reviewer Roberta Smith also described "Space Kitchen' as "resonant balance between pictorial and physical." On the walls are "shallow, translucent plastic trays" filled with "watercolor-thin acrylic pastel shades" within, which Smith describes as a "lunar luminosity" with "skewed spherical forms." Sarah King adds that 'Space Kitchen' had an "ethereal cosmic quality" and seemed to "glow from within".Tompkins describes herself as “a painter [who] aims to interpret the world around [her] and to visually reconstruct and remodel [her] lived experience in a variety of ways.[She] is inspired by the mimetic quality of paint - the fact that paint can turn into something. It’s like a renewable energy. [She] wants to make things out of paint that are both outer-worldly, yet ordinary at the same time.”Tompkins work is often described as and compared to the early works of Georgia O'Keeffe.
