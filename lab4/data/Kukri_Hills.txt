Kukri Hills (77°44′S 162°42′E) is a prominent east-west trending range, about 25 nautical miles (46 km) long and over 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) high, forming the divide between Ferrar Glacier on the south and Taylor Glacier and Taylor Valley on the north, in Victoria Land, Antarctica.The hills were discovered by the Discovery Expedition (1901–04) and probably so named because its shape resembles that of the Kukri, a Gurkha knife.
