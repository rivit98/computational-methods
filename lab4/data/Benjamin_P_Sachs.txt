=== Harvard Medical School ===
In 1978, Sachs started work at the Harvard Medical School.  He would eventually serve as chairman of the OB/GYN Department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and the Harvard Medical School.  Sachs was also appointed as the Harold H. Rosenfield Professor at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health (1997-2007)
Sachs and Major Peter Nielsen, MD, led a team to transfer the concept of crew resource management to obstetrical care. Funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and the Harvard Risk Management Foundation, this was the first major research effort to evaluate team training in healthcare. This crew resource management program formed the basis for TeamSTEPPS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's national program.  TeamSTEPPS is used in hospital Ob/Gyn, surgical, emergency medicine and ICU care departments.
Sachs helped create a research team led by Dr. Ananth Karumanchi that discovered the probable cause of preeclampsia. The team's research was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of Clinical Investigation, Nature Medicine, and was described in The New Yorker.
Sachs was also served as president of the Beth Israel-Deaconess Physician Organization.

It received the 2010 Association of American Medical Colleges Spencer Foreman Award for outstanding community service.Sachs served at Tulane for six years as Senior Vice President, dean of the Medical School and the James R.
