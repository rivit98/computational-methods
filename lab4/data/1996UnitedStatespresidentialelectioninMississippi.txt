== Partisan background ==
The presidential election of 1996 was a very multi-partisan election for Mississippi, with almost seven percent of the electorate voting for third-party candidates. During this election, the vast majority of counties in Mississippi voted in majority for the Republican candidate, with the notable exceptions of Jacksonâ€™s highly populated Hinds County and a Democratic stronghold of counties bordering the Mississippi River, which tended to vote Democratic during this time.
In his second bid for the presidency, Ross Perot led the newly reformed Reform Party to gain over 5% of the votes in Mississippi, and to pull in support nationally as the most popular third-party candidate to run for United States Presidency in recent times. As of the 2016 presidential election, this is the last election in which the following counties voted for a Democratic presidential candidate: Alcorn, Amite, Lawrence, Walthall, and Montgomery.
