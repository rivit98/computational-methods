The Ferrari 412 T2 was the car with which Ferrari competed in the 1995 Formula One World Championship.
Designed by John Barnard and Gustav Brunner, the car's design was largely influenced by major regulation changes imposed by the FIA after the dreadful events during the year before: the V12 engine was reduced from 3.5 to 3.0 litre, while new side protection structures were added around the driver's helmet. The aerodynamics were revised with the sides shortened to fit the radiators and other accessories, while front and rear wings were also changed to reduce downforce according to the new regulations. The T stood for Transverse, as the gearbox was mounted in this way, improving rear-end weight distribution.

This car was a step ahead compared to previous year's 412 T1, but still not able to bring Ferrari back into the fight for the title. Jean Alesi won in Canada, and both he and Berger finished on the podium in several other races, scoring 73 points in total. This placed Ferrari in third place in the Constructors' standings for 1995. 
The last Formula One car to win a World Championship race using a V12 engine, the 412 T2 was also the last Formula 1 car powered by a V12 engine, and the last Ferrari Formula One car to run on Agip fuel.
Both Alesi and Berger moved to Benetton for the 1996 season, and were replaced by Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine. Schumacher tested with the 412 T2 and declared the car to be "good enough to win a world championship."The 412 T2 was replaced by the Ferrari F310 in 1996.
