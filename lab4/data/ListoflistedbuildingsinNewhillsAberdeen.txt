Category A: "buildings of national or international importance, either architectural or historic; or fine, little-altered examples of some particular period, style or building type."
Category B: "buildings of regional or more than local importance; or major examples of some particular period, style or building type, which may have been altered."
Category C: "buildings of local importance; lesser examples of any period, style, or building type, as originally constructed or moderately altered; and simple traditional buildings which group well with other listed buildings."In March 2016 there were 47,288 listed buildings in Scotland.
