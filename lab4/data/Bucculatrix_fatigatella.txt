Bucculatrix fatigatella is a moth in the family Bucculatricidae. It was described by Carl von Heyden in 1863. It is found in the Alps.The larvae feed on Achillea millefolium, Artemisia alpina and Artemisia umbelliformis. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a narrow corridor following the leaf margin, with a broad, continuous frass line. Older larvae live freely on the leaf, creating small round fleck mines. Larvae can be found in June.
