The Oxford Ibsen is a book series containing the most comprehensive English translations of the playwright Henrik Ibsen's collected works, edited by James Walter McFarlane and published between 1960 and 1977. It is an important edition as the releases of Ibsen's plays usually are often translated into third languages through The Oxford Ibsen, rather than from the original Norwegian source texts. It also contains some drafts and preparations, and each play has a foreword that informs about first performances on stage, interpretation and reception. The Oxford series is still missing some of Ibsen's articles, reviews, speeches, correspondence, and poetry.
