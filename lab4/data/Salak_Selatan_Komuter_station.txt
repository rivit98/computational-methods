The Salak Selatan Komuter station is a KTM Komuter train station located near the township of Salak South, Kuala Lumpur. Facing the Salak Expressway off exit 2704 of the highway, the station is situated south from the old town of Salak South, about 400m apart.
The station primarily serves Seremban Line train services, but located along a four-lane railway (two acceptance routes at both ends and two basic routes in the middle), the station is also in charge of managing railway switches and supports a small railway staff team. The station is also linked to storage facilities for and management of machinery for track maintenance. The station, like many stations along the KTM Komuter lines, has only two platforms for northbound or southbound passengers.
The  SP13  Salak Selatan LRT station, located next to old Salak South, is also situated 400m from the Komuter station, requiring the user leaving any of the two stations to walk along a stretch of road to reach the other station. Due to the distance between both stations, they are not effectively integrated or regarded as connecting stations.
