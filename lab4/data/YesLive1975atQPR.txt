Yes: Live – 1975 at Q.P.R. is a video release of a 1975 concert by the group Yes at Queens Park Rangers' Loftus Road stadium in England. Some of the footage was originally broadcast on The Old Grey Whistle Test. The performance was available for many years as a bootleg before former Yes manager Brian Lane co-ordinated a 1993 2-volume VHS release without any input from, or consultation with, the band members. In 2001 the video had a 2-disc DVD release.
