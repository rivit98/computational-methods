== History ==
Compared to other papers in Boston in the 1840s, the Traveller was notable for its significantly lower retail price, and for being sold on the street. It supported the views of the Free Soil Party and the Republican Party. Its office was at no.31 State Street (c.1851–1894).In 1857 the Boston Atlas, the Boston Chronicle and the Evening Telegraph were merged into the Traveller. As of 1878, one guide described it as "the largest four-page evening paper in New England: five editions daily; the semi-weekly and weekly of each week contains sermons of Henry Ward Beecher; 'Review of the Week;' market and shipping reports; latest news and choice reading, prepared expressly for the family fireside."Among the publishers: Roland Worthington. Editors included Ferdinand Andrews, Samuel Bowles, James W. Clark,  Reuben Cook, Ernest Gruening, Manton Marble, Joseph B. Morss, George Punchard, Albert Edward Winship. Contributors included William Foster Apthorp, Charles Creighton Hazewell, Henry James.In the 1900s, the paper was headquartered at no.76 Summer Street (c.1902–1912). In 1912 the Herald bought the Traveler and merged the papers into the Boston Traveler and Evening Herald, now published from the Herald's facility at no.171 Tremont Street. "The new company published the morning Herald and the evening Traveler until 1967, when, due to declining circulation, they were combined into a morning newspaper known as the Herald-Traveler."
