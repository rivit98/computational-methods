== The van ==
The titular "Supervan" was customized by George Barris, based on a stock Dodge Sportsman van.  Among its most unusual features, it featured solar panels, the ability to emit laser beams, and an entire custom body. Coffman called it a "bizarre, 70s-futuristic beast", and there were scale reproductions sold as merchandising for the film, which is unusual for the genre. The film features a cameo appearance by Charles Bukowski


== Quotes ==
This is a movie that takes vans very seriously, (...) the ultimate van nerd movie
