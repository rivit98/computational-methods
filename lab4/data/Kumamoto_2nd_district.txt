Note: The decimals stem from anbunhyō ("proportional fractional votes"), see Elections in Japan#Ballots, voting machines and early voting. As Takeshi (彪) Hayashida and Takeshi (毅) Noda have different Kanji for their given names, some voters must have voted for just "Takeshi" in Kana for the votes to be ambiguous.
