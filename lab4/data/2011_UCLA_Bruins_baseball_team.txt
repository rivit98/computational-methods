The 2011 UCLA Bruins baseball team represented the University of California, Los Angeles in the 2011 NCAA Division I baseball season.  The team played their home games in Jackie Robinson Stadium.  The Bruins finished the season with a 35–24 overall record, and won the Pacific-10 Conference Championship with 18 wins and 9 losses.  The team automatically qualified for the 2011 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament, and were seeded #1 in the Los Angeles Regional. The Bruins lost the first game of the double-elimination format to the San Francisco Dons, 0-3.  They then beat Fresno State 3-1 and San Francisco 4-1 to reach the regional finals.  UC Irvine was undefeated coming into the game, and UCLA would have to beat them twice in order to become the regional champion.  After beating San Francisco a little over one hour earlier, the Bruins took the field at Jackie Robinson stadium as the visiting team at 6 pm.  The Bruins scored one run each in the 1st, 4th, and 5th innings, and gave up two runs each in the 5th and 9th.
