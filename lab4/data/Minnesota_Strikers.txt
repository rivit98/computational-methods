The Minnesota Strikers were an American professional soccer team located in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area. The team played one season (1984) in the North American Soccer League and 4 seasons (1984 to 1988) in the Major Indoor Soccer League.
The Minnesota Strikers' history begins on November 30, 1983, when the Fort Lauderdale Strikers announced they were relocating to Minnesota (three seasons after the Minnesota Kicks folded) for the 1984 NASL season. The team played that year in the North American Soccer League at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, but the league collapsed at the end of the season. The team survived, however, moving indoors and joining the Major Indoor Soccer League. The team played four seasons in the MISL, folding after the 1987–88 season. The team played at Met Center during the MISL years.
