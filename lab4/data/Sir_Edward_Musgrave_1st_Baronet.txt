== English civil war ==
The English Civil War did not deal kindly with Hayton Castle or its owners. Sir Edward Musgrave, created a baronet of Nova Scotia in 1638 was an ardent Royalist, and spared neither his person nor his fortune in this cause. He maintained a regiment of horse at his own expense and in 1648, with the rank of colonel took part in the Battle of Preston. It is recorded that at the Battle of Worcester, when the horse of King Charles II was shot from under him, Sir Edward dismounted and supplied the King with his own horse, thus allowing him to escape. After the defeat Musgrave found refuge in Scotland with the Duke of Gordon, and so badly was he wanted by the Parliament that when his refuge was discovered Cromwell informed the Duke that “if he did not forthwith deliver up Ned Musgrave he would send a troop of horse to storm his castle”. Musgrave was allowed to escape and he fled to the Isle of Man. Sir Edward Musgrave died on 22 November 1673 at Hayton Castle, and the title passed to his eldest son Richard.
