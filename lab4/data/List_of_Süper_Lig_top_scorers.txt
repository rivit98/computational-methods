The Süper Lig top scorers are called Gol Kralı (literally meaning "Goal King" in Turkish) in Turkey. It is the title earned by the top goalscorer in Turkish football league divisions.
The title is currently held by Mbaye Diagne, who scored 30 goals for Galatasaray  in the 2018–19 season
.
The highest number of goals scored is 39, by Tanju Çolak for Galatasaray in 1987–88. Metin Oktay (1962–63) and Hakan Şükür (1996–97) narrowly missed the record; they each scored 38 goals for Galatasaray. Oktay has won the award the most times with six wins in 1959, 1959–60, 1960–61, 1962–63, 1964–65 and 1968–69, which was also his last season. Bosnian Tarik Hodžić was the first non-Turkish winner, when he scored 16 goals for Galatasaray in the 1983–84 season. Oktay (1959, 1960, 1961), Çolak (1986, 1987, 1988) and Şükür (1997, 1998, 1999) are the only players to win the award in three consecutive seasons. Brazilian Alex de Souza is the only foreign player to become top scorer twice. He became top scorer with Fenerbahçe in the 2006–07 and 2010–11 seasons, also winning the Turkish championship title with his club on both occasions. Fenerbahçe are the only club in Süper Lig history to have brought forth the top scorer in four consecutive seasons, from 1991–92 to the 1994–95 season.
Çolak won the European Golden Shoe for his 39 for Galatasaray in 1987–88 and came second with 31 goals in 1990–91. In the 1962–63 season Oktay scored 38 for Galatasaray and became Europe's top scorer. Şükür came third in 1996–97, despite scoring the most goals in Europe.
