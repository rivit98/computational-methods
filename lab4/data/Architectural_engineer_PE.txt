Architectural engineer (PE) is a professional engineering designation in the United States. The architectural engineer applies the knowledge and skills of broader engineering disciplines to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, and renovation of buildings and their component systems while paying careful attention to their effects on the surrounding environment.With the establishment of a specific "Architectural Engineering" NCEES professional engineering registration examination in the 1990s and first offering in April 2003, architectural engineering is now recognized as a distinct engineering discipline in the United States.
Note that in the United States Architects are not to be confused with "architectural engineering technology" which is different from architectural engineering; in the United States architectural engineering technologists tend to be "Engineering Technicians" that utilize CAD technology as drafters or technical assistants who do not have a license to practice either Architecture or Engineering, usually hired by larger construction firms or developers who prefer to cut out architectural design and maintain high costs of construction for standard processes and common building materials, while in Europe, Canada, South Africa and other countries Architectural technologists have a role similar to Architects and Architectural Engineers.


== Areas of focus ==
Architecture (if licensed as an Architect)
Structural engineering
Construction engineering
Construction management
Project management
Green building
Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)
Plumbing and piping (hydronics)
Energy management
Fire protection engineering
Building power systems
Lighting
Building transportation systems
Acoustics, noise & vibration controlA common combined specialization is Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing, better known by its abbreviation MEP.  An MEP design engineer has experience in HVAC, lighting/electrical, and plumbing systems' analysis and design.


== Some topics of special interest ==
Building construction
Building Information Modeling (BIM)
Efficient energy use, Energy conservation or Energy demand management
Renewable energy
Solar energy
Green buildings
Intelligent buildings
Autonomous buildings
Indoor air quality
Thermal comfort
