Alois Friedrich Rogenhofer (22 December 1831, Vienna â€“ 15 January 1897, Vienna) was an Austrian entomologist. He was a curator at the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna, where he was the first keeper of the Lepidoptera. Rogenhofer was mainly interested in Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera.
Beside him Josef Mann (1804-1889) worked as a keen technician and collector for the benefits of the museum. Mann described many species of Lepidoptera new to science focussing on Microlepidoptera.
