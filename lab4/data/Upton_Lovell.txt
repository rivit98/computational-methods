Knook Castle, in the north of the parish, is the site of an Iron Age hillfort. The village of Upton Lovell is an ancient settlement, with a medieval church dedicated to St Augustine of Canterbury. The Domesday Book uses the name "Ubetone", to which the name of Lovel was added while five generations of the Lords Lovel were lords of the manor between the 14th and 16th centuries.The village's pub is called the Prince Leopold, in memory of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, the youngest son of Queen Victoria, who lived at Boyton Manor in the neighbouring village of Boyton. He died of haemophilia in 1884.

The Anglican Church of St Augustine of Canterbury is Grade I listed. It has a 13th-century chancel and a nave built in 1633.  Its parish registers are kept at the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre for the years 1654–1992 (baptisms), 1654–1975 (marriages), and 1653–1991 (burials).
