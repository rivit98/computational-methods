Europe '72: Beat Club, Bremen, West Germany (4/21/1972) is a live album by the Grateful Dead. It was recorded for the Beat-Club TV show instead of at a concert venue. It is notable for being the shortest concert of the tour, because it was a television performance. On the album, the songs "Loser" and "Black-Throated Wind" are not included (they were the soundcheck).
The video shot for the Beat-Club TV episode was shown in movie theaters in the U.S. on July 17, 2014, as that year's Grateful Dead Meet-Up at the Movies.
