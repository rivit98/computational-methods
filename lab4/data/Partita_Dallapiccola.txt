Partita for orchestra, Alla memoria di Ernesto Consolo, is a composition by the Italian composer Luigi Dallapiccola. It was composed between 1930 and 1932.
Partita is the work with which Dallapiccola first came to international recognition. Written in memory of the Italian pianist Ernesto Consolo, it is scored in four movements for orchestra, with a soprano solo in the final movement. In a manner analogous to the finale of Mahler's Fourth Symphony, the setting is a childlike medieval Latin lullaby.The work was premiered at the Teatro Comunale di Firenze on the 22nd of January 1933 by the theatre orchestra under Vittorio Gui, with Laura Pasini as soloist. It had to wait over seventy years for its recorded premiere, however, given by the BBC Philharmonic under Gianandrea Noseda in 2010, with Gillian Keith as soloist. The recording was released on Chandos Records.
