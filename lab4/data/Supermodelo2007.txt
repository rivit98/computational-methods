Supermodelo 2007 was the second season of Supermodelo. Due to the success of the previous season the number of contestants was increased from 13 to 20 girls. The show took place live once every week, where a public vote decided which one of two nominated contestants would be eliminated from the competition, and the judges would nominate a new set of contestants for elimination. The period in between was pre-recorded, and tracked the progress of all the girls as they received lessons on various aspects of modeling, took part in photo shoot sessions and other fashion related challenges. The goal of the show was to find Spain's next representative in the Elite Model Look contest.
The winner of the competition was 21-year-old Noelia López from Seville.
