=== U from Uruguay ===
U From Uruguay, also known as "Pepe's perfume", is a conceptual piece featuring a perfume made by the artist with the essences extracted from the flowers grown by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica. From the funds risen by the perfume, 90% will be destinated to the creation of the first National Contemporary Art Fund in support of Latin American artists.
The fragrance was made a few months after, the artist collected, together with the president and his wife, senator Lucía Topolansky chrysanthemums and wild native Uruguayan herbs in the farm Rincón del Cerro, home of the president and his wife.
Only three bottles of this fragrance "U From Uruguay" have been produced, being the first one owned by President Mujica and the second one by the author. The only bottle for sale was auctioned on 31 May 2013 during the opening of the IILA (Instituto Italo-Latinoamericano)  pavilion, within the framework of the 55th Venice Biennial
"U From Uruguay" was finally acquired for 50.000 dollars by Argentinian entrepreneur Alan Faena thanks to the intervention of Argentinian artist Marta Minujín as ambassador.
Minujín final offer turned the 33-milliliter bottle of "U from Uruguay" into the world's most expensive perfume fragrance ever existed, overcoming the Imperial Majesty created in 1872 at the request of Queen Victoria of England and back to be manufactured some years ago by Clive Christian, valued at $1,400 millilitre.
“U From Uruguay” is already part of the Faena Arts Center (FAC) collection, coordinated by Ximena Caminos in Buenos Aires.
