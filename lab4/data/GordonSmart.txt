== Journalism career ==
Smart's career in journalism started at DC Thomson in Dundee where he was employed as a junior reporter on the Evening Telegraph and Dundee Courier in June 1998. He studied journalism at Napier University in Edinburgh.
Unable to find work in newspapers Smart turned to football earning a living coaching for Dutch company Coerver between 2001â€“02. After a second serious football injury he returned to Scotland to work for Deadline Press and Picture Agency, covering news in the east of Scotland. During the MTV Europe Music Awards held in Edinburgh in 2003, Smart got his big break after a former colleague from DC Thomson introduced him to Victoria Newton, then editor of the Bizarre showbiz column of The Sun newspaper.

In his opening column for the paper, he formed a 'cabinet' around himself comprising Pete Samson ("Office of the minister of music"), Danielle Lawler and other deputies. Lawler left to join The Daily Mirror as a 3am Girl soon after, while Samson now holds the US Editor position at The Sun.Smart moved to become deputy editor of the Sun in London in May 2016 but left the paper altogether in November 2016 to focus on other business and broadcasting interests.
