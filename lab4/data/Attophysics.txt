Attophysics  also known as attoscience is a branch of physics wherein attosecond (10−18 s) duration pulses of electrons or photons are used to probe dynamic processes in matter with unprecedented time resolution.[1] The majority of attoscience employs pump–probe methods.
One of the primary goals of attosecond science is to provide more insights into the dynamics of electrons in molecules.[2]Today, attophysicists mostly study molecular phenomena, such as how a particular protein breaks down under X-ray bombardment.
