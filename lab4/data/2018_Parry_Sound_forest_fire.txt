The fire was first discovered on July 18, 2018. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), the Ontario government ministry responsible for battling forest fires, began immediate efforts to contain the blaze. By July 23, 2018, the fire had covered 50 km2 (12,000 acres), forcing evacuations and a state of emergency in the community of Henvey Inlet First Nation, as well as evacuations of people in French River Provincial Park.The fire grew to 67 km2 (17,000 acres) by July 26, 2018. By July 28, 2018, the fire was within 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) of Highway 69. By August 5, the fire had grown to 112.3 km2 (27,700 acres), but the fire was successfully contained within a few days after this. On October 31, 2018 the wildfire was declared extinguished by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.


== Investigation ==
An investigation by the MNRF ruled that the fire was started by a disabled ATV near Henvey Inlet. This confirmed unofficial reports that construction crews working on the Henvey Inlet Wind Project were unable to contain a fire started by one of their vehicles. The ministry has decided not to raise charges against the construction company.
