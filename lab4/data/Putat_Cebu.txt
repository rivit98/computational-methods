Putat (; Cebuano: Barangay Putat, Filipino: Barangay Putat) is a human settlement in the Philippine Municipality of Tuburan, Cebu in Central Visayas which is part of the Visayas group of islands. The name Putat came from the name of the tree, putat which is the famous tree in that place that it could be proud of. But until this generation, no one of Putatnons knew when Putat was settled to become the Barangay Putat.


== History ==
Until this present time, no one know when Putat was settled and perhaps its foundation maybe traced back when Don Mariano Montebon founded the Municipality of Tuburan in 1851. Even if no one knew when it was founded; Putat certainly got its name from the name of the tree "putat", a tree that belongs to genus Barringtonia. Old folks said that these trees thrived in the riverbanks and swamps on the place a long time ago but nowadays, one can rarely see it thriving and maybe considered as endangered. Some people also believe in the legend of how the tree first came into the place.
