== So-called Badge-factory ==
Since the enactment of the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act in 2004, "qualified law enforcement officer" and “qualified retired or separated law enforcement officer" have been given permission to carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction in the United States, regardless of state or local laws, with certain exceptions. In 2018, it was revealed that billionaire Robert Mercer (owner of Breitbart News, Cambridge Analytica, and others) was a volunteer policeman with Lake Arthur Police Department from 2011. This enrolment permitted him to carry a concealed weapon in all 50 states. Mercer also obtained police badges (old-fashioned stars) for bodyguards working for the Koch brothers and Breitbart news. The police department was shut down in April 2018 after these "badges-for-cash" were reported in the media.
