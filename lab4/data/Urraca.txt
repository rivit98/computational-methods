Urraca (also spelled Hurraca, Urracha and Hurracka in medieval Latin) is a female first name. In  Spanish, the name means magpie, derived perhaps from Latin furax, meaning "thievish", in reference to the magpie's tendency to collect shiny items. The name may be of Basque origin, as suggested by onomastic analysis.
