In enzymology, an alanylphosphatidylglycerol synthase (EC 2.3.2.11) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-alanyl-tRNA + phosphatidylglycerol 
  
    
      
        ⇌
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }
   tRNA + 3-O-L-alanyl-1-O-phosphatidylglycerolThus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-alanyl-tRNA and phosphatidylglycerol, whereas its two products are tRNA and 3-O-L-alanyl-1-O-phosphatidylglycerol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the aminoacyltransferases.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-alanyl-tRNA:phosphatidylglycerol alanyltransferase. Other names in common use include O-alanylphosphatidylglycerol synthase, and alanyl phosphatidylglycerol synthetase.
