Cserszegi fűszeres is a white Hungarian wine-grape variety. It is named after its place of origin: the village of Cserszegtomaj, near Keszthely. The attribute fűszeres means spicy.


== Origin and character ==
The white Cserszegi fűszeres grape is a hybrid between Irsai Olivér and Roter Traminer, so that it is a member of the Traminer family closely related to Gewürztraminer. It was created in 1960 by Károly Bakonyi (died 2010) of the Pannon University of Agriculture.The grape variety has a high yield with high sugar content. It is less sensitive to cold, but may suffer from drought. It ripens early and is picked in the second half of September. Its wines are dry or off dry and have a distinctive aroma and a spicy taste with a harmonious acidity. The variety is often known informally as "spiced wine" in Hungary.
Cserszegi fűszeres wine in Hungary comes mainly from vineyards in the Csongrád, Hajós–Baja and Kunság regions of the Great Hungarian Plain and the Etyek–Buda, Balatonfelvidék, Zala and Mecsek regions of Transdanubia.
