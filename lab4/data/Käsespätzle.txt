Hot spätzle and grated granular cheese are layered alternately and are finally decorated with fried onions. After adding each layer the käsespätzle is put into the oven to avoid cooling off and to ensure that the cheese melts.
Accompanying side dishes are green salads or potato salad. In Vorarlberg and also in Liechtenstein käsespätzle is usually served with apple sauce. Residuals of käsespätzle is fried with butter in a pan.

In Swabia käsespätzle are prepared with Bergkäse or Emmental cheese, optionally with both. In Vorarlberg two different cheese varieties are dominating, so in Montafon the cooks use Montafon sour cheese and in Bregenz Forest they use Bergkäse and Räßkäse, a local hard cheese.Side dishes in Vorarlberg are butter and yellowly tarnished onion rings.Different variations are found with Limburger, Weisslacker or Vorarlberger Bergkäse.
