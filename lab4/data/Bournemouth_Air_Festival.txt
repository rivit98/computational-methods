The Bournemouth Air Festival is an annual air show held along the coast at Bournemouth, in Dorset, England. It has featured aircraft from the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy, as well as civil aviation displays. Since its formation in 2008, the festival claims to have entertained over nine million people.

=== 2010 ===
The 2010 Bournemouth Air Festival was marred by poor weather although the general public still enjoyed the static displays and the small amount of flying that took place.


=== 2011 - Third Annual Air Festival & Red Arrow’s Crash ===
The 2011 event took place between 18–21 August. On Saturday 20 August, at approximately 13:50 BST, one of the Red Arrows, Red Four, crashed in a field, approximately 1 km near to Bournemouth Airport. The pilot, Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging, was killed in the accident, when returning to the airport after a display at the Air Festival.An inquest heard Flt Lt Egging may have succumbed to G-force impairment before attempting to correct his course in the moments before the impact.
The coroner in Bournemouth recorded a verdict of accidental death. The court heard a service inquiry, led by Wing Cdr Mark Rodden, concluded "A-loc" - almost loss of consciousness due to G-force - was the likely cause of the crash.
Memorial Sculpture and Relocation after Clifftop Landslide:
Prior to the 2012 Bournemouth Air Festival, a memorial sculpture was unveiled in a private ceremony at the top of the East Cliff at Bournemouth Beach. The sculpture is of three glass Red Arrows planes and stainless steel contrails.
In August 2017, the memorial sculpture was relocated further along the East Cliff, at the top of the Zig-Zag, after a landslide on 24 April 2016. Rubble fell down the 30m-high (100 ft) rock face in East Cliff, partially engulfing the carriages of an Edwardian funicular railway - known as East Cliff Lift and a crushing a block of toilets. There were no reported injuries as a result of the landslide.
Although undamaged in the landslide, the Jon Egging memorial was close to the edge and was sealed off from public view.
