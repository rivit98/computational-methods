== Governance ==
The Welsh Netball Association (Cymdeithas Pêl Rwyd Cymru) was created in 1945.

The Welsh Netball Association is based in Pontcanna, Cardiff.


== History ==
In the period between 1902 and 1925, copies of the netball rule book published by the Ling Association of England were sold in Wales. Marion Morton was involved in organizing netball in South Wales during the late 1930s.  She was based out of the Mary Datchelor School.  Marion Morton helped work towards the formation of the Welsh Netball Association. During and preceding the 1970s, most of the world, outside of New Zealand and Australia, played a one handed variety of netball.  This allowed a more fluid type of game, with longer passes designed to open up the court. Like other national associations, the Welsh have created a modified version of the game for children called 'Dragon Netball'. It is geared for seven- to eleven-year-olds. Male participation in netball in Wales has been increasing in the past several years.
