== High school ==

As a junior, he played first at Oxon Hill High School in Maryland where he averaged 22.3 points per game, and then transferred to South Kent Prep School where he averaged 21.5 points, 4 rebounds and 5 assists. He was named a First-Team Prep School All-American and played in the Reebok All-American game and the Derby Festival.

ESPN ranked him as the #15 shooting guard in his class and #61 in the class overall. In the summer he played AAU basketball for Triple Threat.


== College career ==
Creek chose to play collegiate basketball for the Indiana University Hoosiers and major in sport communication broadcast, turning down offers from Marquette, Maryland, Pittsburgh and Texas. Upon committing to Indiana he said among his goals was to "try to get to the national championship to show everybody that Indiana is alive and is always going to be alive for the rest of the time we live."
As a freshman during the 2009-10 season, Creek started the first 12 games of the year before suffering a season-ending injury. In the team's game against Kentucky that year he scored 31 points on 9-of-14 shooting, including 5-of-8 from behind the arc. Following that game he was the top scoring freshman in the country with a 17.3 point average through the first nine games. In seven straight games he scored in double figures and, prior to his injury, was in early discussions for freshman of the year honors.
As a sophomore during the 2010-11 season Creek played in 18 games and started 13 before once again suffering a season-ending injury, this time a stress fracture in his knee that required surgery. Remarkably, just days before the Hoosiers reached the official start of practice for the 2011-12 season, Creek suffered yet another injury, this time a torn left Achilles. The injury was his third within 22 months and caused him to sit out the entire season. As a result, Creek decided to redshirt and is now considered part of the 2014 graduating class with Victor Oladipo and Will Sheehey.
In June 2013, he transferred to The George Washington University for his final year of eligibility, where he became the team's leading scorer and hit a buzzer beater to defeat the Maryland Terrapins. That team reached the NCAA tournament, GW's first in a few years.
