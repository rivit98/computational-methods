In mathematics, a homogeneous polynomial is a polynomial whose nonzero terms all have the same degree. For example, 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            5
          
        
        +
        2
        
          x
          
            3
          
        
        
          y
          
            2
          
        
        +
        9
        x
        
          y
          
            4
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{5}+2x^{3}y^{2}+9xy^{4}}
   is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5, in two variables; the sum of the exponents in each term is always 5. The polynomial 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            3
          
        
        +
        3
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        y
        +
        
          z
          
            7
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{3}+3x^{2}y+z^{7}}
   is not homogeneous, because the sum of exponents does not match from term to term. A polynomial is homogeneous if and only if it defines a homogeneous function.  An algebraic form, or simply form, is a function defined by a homogeneous polynomial. A binary form is a form in two variables. A form is also a function defined on a vector space, which may be expressed as a homogeneous function of the coordinates over any basis.
A polynomial of degree 0 is always homogeneous; it is simply an element of the field or ring of the coefficients, usually called a constant or a scalar. A form of degree 1 is a linear form. A form of degree 2 is a quadratic form. In geometry, the Euclidean distance is the square root of a quadratic form.
Homogeneous polynomials are ubiquitous in mathematics and physics. They play a fundamental role in algebraic geometry, as a projective algebraic variety is defined as the set of  the common zeros of a set of homogeneous polynomials.


== Properties ==
A homogeneous polynomial defines a homogeneous function. This means that, if a multivariate polynomial P is homogeneous of degree d, then

  
    
      
        P
        (
        λ
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        λ
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        )
        =
        
          λ
          
            d
          
        
        
        P
        (
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        )
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(\lambda x_{1},\ldots ,\lambda x_{n})=\lambda ^{d}\,P(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\,,}
  for every 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   in any field containing the coefficients of P. Conversely, if the above relation is true for infinitely many  
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   then the polynomial is homogeneous of degree d.
In particular, if P is homogeneous then 

  
    
      
        P
        (
        
          x

            n

        =
        0
        
        ⇒
        
        P
        (
        λ
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        λ
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        )
        =
        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})=0\quad \Rightarrow \quad P(\lambda x_{1},\ldots ,\lambda x_{n})=0,}
  for every 
  
    
      
        λ
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda .}
   This property is fundamental in the definition of a projective variety.
Any nonzero polynomial may be decomposed, in a unique way, as a sum of homogeneous polynomials of different degrees, which are called the homogeneous components of the polynomial. 
Given a polynomial ring

    {\displaystyle R=K[x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]}
   over a field (or, more generally, a ring) K, the homogeneous polynomials of degree d form
a vector space (or a module), commonly denoted

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{d}.}
   The above unique decomposition means that 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}

   (sum over all nonnegative integers).
The dimension of the vector space (or free module)

    {\displaystyle R_{d}}
