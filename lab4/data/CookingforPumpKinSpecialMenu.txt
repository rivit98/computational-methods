Cooking for Pump-Kin: Special Menu is a compilation album by Euro House DJ/producer Benny Benassi released in 2007. This is the second release on  the Pump-Kin Music label.
This is the official compilation from Benny Benassi's 'Canadian Bus Tour'.
"I wanted to do this tour across Canada in a bus and not by a plane to get to know the country better. I've played my sets in various towns over the past few years and I've always wished to come back and explore. I also thought it would be a good idea to have a kind of souvenir of my Canadian journey to share with all the people who come out and party when I play. That's the reason behind this compilation. I really hope you have as much fun listening to it as I did mixing it. Thanks, Benny".
