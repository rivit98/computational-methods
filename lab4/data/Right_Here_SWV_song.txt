"Right Here" is the debut single by the American R&B girl group SWV. It was released on August 20, 1992 as the lead single from their debut album It's About Time (1992), and charted on the Billboard charts as a double-A-side with "Downtown". A remixed version, referred to as "Right Here (Human Nature Remix)" and based around a sample of Michael Jackson's 1982 song "Human Nature", became a number-one R&B single, selling 500,000 copies and earning a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. According to Billboard, in 1993, the song spent 22 weeks on the US Hot 100 (18 of which were also spent in the Mainstream Top 40) and from 1993-94 it spent 34 weeks on the R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay, making it one of the most successful R&B songs of 1993.Despite the huge success of the single, the group said in early 2014 that they did not like Teddy Riley's remix.Billboard named the Human Nature Remix of the song number 17 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.


== Original and remixed song ==
The original version of "Right Here" was released in the third quarter of 1992. It peaked at number 13 on the Hot R&B Singles chart. Tamara "Taj" Johnson wrote and performed the bridge to the original song, which would result in her first (of many) co-writing credits on SWV songs.
The "Human Nature" remix by Teddy Riley samples Michael Jackson's 1982 hit "Human Nature". One of their best known hits, it spent seven weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot R&B Singles chart, as well as three weeks atop the Rhythmic Top 40 chart. It became one of the longest running number-one R&B singles of 1993. It also peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, held from the top spot by Mariah Carey's "Dreamlover." It also reached the top ten in Europe, including the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number three in September 1993."Right Here [Human Nature Remix]" appears on the soundtrack and in the film Free Willy. The first verse of the Human Nature remix varies slightly from the original version, and the rapped bridge is omitted. The remix also features a young Pharrell Williams chanting "S...The double...The U...The V!" during the song. This became a common "call" during the group's concerts.
"Right Here [Human Nature Remix]" was later remixed again for SWV's EP The Remixes as a more obvious mash-up with the song's sample, "Human Nature" by Michael Jackson, whose vocals are featured in the remixed duet. The "Human Nature" remix has also been sampled by the late rapper 2Pac on the track "Thug Nature" from Too Gangsta for Radio (2001). Pop singer Chris Brown's song "She Ain't You" (2011) samples Michael Jackson's "Human Nature" and a portion of SWV's remixed version. Human Nature was also sampled by Nas in the hit song "It Ain't Hard To Tell" on his debut album Illmatic.


== Critical reception ==
Billboard commented that the original version has a "rigid funk/R&B beat-bottom" that "marks an intriguing contrast to loose, personality-driven vocals" by Cheryl Gamble. They also noted that she is further supported by "En Vogue-style backing vocals and a sassy rap break" by Tamara Johnson. Smash Hits gave the Human Nature Remix 4 out of 5. They wrote that "Michael Jackson's Human Nature is the perfect vehicle for their high harmonies and they have turned his old choirboy rendition into something with much more sass and soul. It's a welcome revival of a good tune. And they've it done even better than Michael did!" Charles Aaron from Spin described the 1993 remix as a "total radio swoon and uncanny appropriation that lets you enjoy Michael Jackson in a way not heard since, say, "O.P.P." Thank Teddy Riley for the remix, but this female trio relaxes, croons, and converses so lovely, you gotta feel suave." In 2017, Spin ranked the song at number 20 in their list of The 30 Best ’90s R&B Songs.


== Music videos ==
Both versions of "Right Here" have music videos. The video to the original song begins with Coko discussing a man she likes to Taj and Lelee. It features the singers having flashbacks to boys they liked as young girls, then is brought to the present day with the women and their boyfriends. In between, the girls goof off together in a large, mirrored room. "Right Here" was the first of their videos to showcase the group's dancing skills.
The music video directed by Lionel C. Martin to the remixed version begins with SWV riding horses and fishing on an island's coast, and are shown performing with a band. An alternate version of the "Human Nature Remix" video features scenes from Free Willy along with clips of Michael Jackson performing during his 1992 Dangerous Tour.
The "Human Nature" remix is the more recognized version of the single, and is the one that is usually performed at SWV concerts. However, the original version (complete with the rapped bridge) is occasionally performed instead.
