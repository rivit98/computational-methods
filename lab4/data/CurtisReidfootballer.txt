Many of the younger generation in Melbourne will regret to learn of the death of Mr. Curtis A. Reid at the early age of thirty-six. The late Mr. Reid died at Charlesville, Queensland, on Sunday last from typhoid fever. He had a large survey party out in the north, when he was attacked by fever, to which he succumbed after a few days' illness. When telegraphic news arrived of the attack, his wife hurried from Melbourne, and had the melancholy consolation of being with him in his last hours. His father, Curtis A. Reid, was at one time a leading light in Melbourne journalistic and cricketing circles, being for many years secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club. The younger Curtis was equally well known and beloved by a large circle of friends. In addition to a widow he leaves two children, one of them being only a few months old. — Punch, 16 May 1912.
