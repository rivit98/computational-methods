Government revenue is the money received by a government from taxes and non-tax sources to enable it to undertake government expenditures. 
Government revenue as well as government spending are components of the government budget and important tools of the government's fiscal policy. 
Seignorage is one of the ways a government can increase revenue, by deflating the value of its currency in exchange for surplus revenue, by saving money this way governments can increase the price of goods too far.
