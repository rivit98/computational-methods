== Crimes and disturbing issues ==
In the years of 2007-8 the Cambodian Government, was responsible for the sale of 45% of the total landmass in Cambodia to primarily foreign investors. The land concessions are to be used for agro-industrial, forestry, tourism and constructional projects, even though larger parts of the land are wildlife protections or national parks even (See Cardamom Mountains for example). The vast majority of the Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) have in fact been issued in violation of Cambodia’s 2001 Land Law and its Subdecree on ELCs and are therefore illegal. 
The landsales has been perceived by observers, to be the result of extensive land grabbing and corruption within the judicial system, ministries and government bureaucracy of Cambodia. It has stirred serious unrest across the country, within recent years.
