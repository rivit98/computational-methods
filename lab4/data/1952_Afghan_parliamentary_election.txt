A royal proclamation was issued calling upon the people to elect the eighth National Assembly, consisting of 171 seats, within three months. As no census of population has ever been taken there were no electoral lists, the February 1952 election in Afghanistan consisted in calling public meetings in which people voted for the official candidates by acclamation. In Kabul, where the election took place on April 20, there were two opposition candidates, but the government candidates were said to be elected by considerable majorities; however, out of about 50,000 entitled to vote, only 7,000 actually voted.
