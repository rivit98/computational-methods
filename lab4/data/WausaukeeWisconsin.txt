Wausaukee is a Menominee word that means “river in the hills.” The town was started in 1863 by John S. Monroe, who bought 160 acres of land from business tycoon Lars Kovala and built a mill to supply the railroads with lumber for bridges and culverts. His first building was a log cabin home that was also used to board the mill workers. As the town grew and more settlers moved in, his log cabin grew into an inn that was the only public eating establishment north of Green Bay.On August 19, 2011 at 4:45pm, an EF1 tornado struck Wausaukee.
