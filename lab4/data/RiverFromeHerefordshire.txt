The River Frome is a river in Herefordshire, England. It flows through Bromyard, and Bishops Frome. Immediately below the depopulated village of Stretton Grandison its tributary, the river or brook named the Lodon, joins it. It then flows west, past Yarkhill and  the farmstead or locality of Prior's Frome before its confluence with the Lugg (which skirts the north side of Hereford here) at Hampton Bishop about 2 miles (3.2 km) before the latter joins the Wye.
The river gives its name to hamlets on the high ground to the east: Halmond's Frome, Fromes Hill and Castle Frome.
In 2007, like many other rivers in England, the Frome burst its banks. This occurred at places including lower parts of Bromyard, causing homes to be evacuated. A smaller scale recurrence occurred in April and July 2012.
