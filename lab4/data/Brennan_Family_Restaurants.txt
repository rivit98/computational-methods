Owen Brennan's is a licensee of Brennan's in New Orleans.  Owen Brennan's opened its doors to customers in 1990 under a partnership of investors.  Burt Wolf was the general partner.  In 1991, James (Jim) Austin Baker, Jr., became the general partner.  Jim later bought out all of the investors with his son, James Austin Baker III under BakCO LLC.
In 1993, John Grisham's book-to-movie, "The Firm" featured Owen Brennan's in a business lunch meeting between Tom Cruise & Gene Hackman in cocktail area of the restaurant. Owen Brennan's commemorated the filming by placing plaques on the two cocktail chairs where Tom Cruise and Gene Hackman sat.
