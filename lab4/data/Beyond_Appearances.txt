Beyond Appearances is the fourteenth studio album by Santana, released in 1985 (see 1985 in music).
The album took seven months to make, and (apart from Carlos Santana himself) involved a completely different line-up from Santana's previous album (released two and a half years earlier).  It was firmly in the style of the 1980s, making much use of synthesizers and drum machines.  Beyond Appearances performed relatively poorly, reaching only fifty on the Billboard album chart; one of its tracks, "Say It Again", reached number 46 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart (though it performed better on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, reaching number fifteen).The album is notable for the presence of both drummer Chester Thompson and his namesake, keyboards player Chester D. Thompson on the same record with the same band.
