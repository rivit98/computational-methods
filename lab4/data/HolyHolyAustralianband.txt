=== 2011–2013: Formation and The Pacific EP ===

Australian-born songwriters Timothy Carroll and Oscar Dawson initially met as volunteer English teachers in Southeast Asia. They reconnected in 2011 while Carroll was living in Stockholm. Dawson had moved to Berlin with his then-band, Dukes of Windsor. When Dawson visited in Sweden, Carroll asked him to assist with some songs, which later formed the basis for their debut extended play, The Pacific EP.Holy Holy released their first single, "Impossible Like You", independently in May 2013 and the band played their first shows in capital cities of Australia. They signed to Sydney label, Wonderlick Entertainment in December 2013, and released The Pacific EP in March 2013. Meanwhile, Carroll enlisted drummer Ryan Strathie (ex-Hungry Kids of Hungary) and bass guitarist Graham Ritchie (ex-Emma Louise, Airling), to join the band. Producer Matt Redlich (of Ball Park Music, Emma Louise, the Trouble with Templeton), joined them as a guest touring musician on keyboards and backing vocals. The five-piece version of Holy Holy opened for Boy & Bear, the Preatures and Ball Park Music.
