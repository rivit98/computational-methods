Ballinteer originally consisted of some housing groups off Ballinteer Avenue (Mayfield Terrace, Ballinteer Gardens, and Ballinteer Park), built between the 1920s and 1950s, and locally referred to as 'Old Ballinteer'.

The latter four roads were originally called Lissadel Estate when built in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The sprawling estate of Broadford was built between the mid-1970s and early 1980s along with the ex-council estate Hillview. The most recent estate, Ballintyre, began construction in 2005 and was finished in mid-2008.
