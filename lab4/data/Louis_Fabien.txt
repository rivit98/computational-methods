Fabien was born in L'Isle-Jourdain in the French département of Vienne. He is a self-taught figurative painter of the School of Paris who uses a modern form of pointillism. He paints in a realistic style and tries to capture colorful and often charming moments.
Fabien has exhibited his work in most of the important Paris salon shows and has had one-man shows in many countries including France, United States, Japan, England, and Germany. He began to show his work in the early 1950s in the Salon d'Automne and in 1953 exhibited in the Salon de la Jeune Peinture, of which he was elected president in 1964 and in 1965. In 1957 he was accorded the Prix Greenshields.
Fabien's paintings have been acquired by the French State, the City of Paris, and the Petit Palais of Geneva.
