== Theatre ==

He is particularly outstanding in his creation of the Multimedia Music Theatre Series, which is a conglomeration of dexterous uses of theatre space, texts, video images and cutting-edge multimedia technologies. His endeavours in this music theatre series are groundbreaking, and his attempt in such theatre productions is the first of its kind in Hong Kong. Stan Lai once said: "To know where the trend goes, you just need to find out where Mathias Woo is." Woo's works have been presented around the world in cities like Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuzhen, Macau, Taipei, Tokyo, Singapore, Berlin, Brussels, Milan and Krakow of Poland.
Woo’s theatre works cover a wide range of topics, such as literature, history, politics and current affairs, architecture and religion. His major works include 1587, A Year of No Significance (an adaptation from historian Ray Huang’s book of the same title), Eighteen Springs, Hua-Yen Sutra (a new media pictorial of Buddhist’s ancient text), East Wing West Wing (a political satire series), Kunqu opera Tang Xianzhu’s Dream on Dreams and A Tale of The Forbidden City.
Woo pioneered the “multimedia architecture music theatre series”, like The Architecture of The City (inspired by the same title of Aldo Rossi), The Life and Time of Louis I. Kahn became the hallmark in the scene of Chinese theatre. He also created multimedia performances, such as Hua-yen Sutra, integrating Buddhist doctrines with interactive multimedia and elements of contemporary arts. They were great successes merging theatre spaces and the multi-media together, exploring the potentials of these features to the fullest. They infuse new dynamic into Hong Kong performing arts, and are vanguards in the history of Chinese theatre.
