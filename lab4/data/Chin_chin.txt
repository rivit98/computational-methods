Chin chin is a fried snack in Nigeria, West Africa.
It is similar to the Scandinavian snack klenat, a crunchy, donut-like baked or fried dough of wheat flour, and other customary baking items. Chin chin may contain cowpeas. Many people bake it with ground nutmeg for flavor. 
The dough is usually kneaded and cut into small one-inch (or so) squares, about a quarter of an inch thick, before frying.
