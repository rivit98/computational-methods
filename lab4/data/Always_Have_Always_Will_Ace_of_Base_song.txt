"Always Have Always Will" is a single by Swedish pop band Ace of Base. Heavily inspired by the Motown sound of the mid-1960s, the intro samples the intros from the Supremes track "Where Did Our Love Go" and the Four Tops track "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". It was co-written by Jonas Berggren with Mike Chapman. The song was originally titled "Killer on the Rampage" and contained different lyrics. When the song was pitched as a potential song for the upcoming Flowers/Cruel Summer album, Arista records liked the melody; however, requested that the lyrics be rewritten.
The song was released from the album Flowers in many parts of the world, but at different times.

UK on 7 December 1998 as single three, following "Life Is a Flower" and "Cruel Summer".
Australia in early 1999 as the second single, following "Cruel Summer"
Scandinavia & Germany on 1 March 1999 as single four, following "Life Is a Flower", "Cruel Summer", and "Travel to Romantis".


== Critical reception ==
Quentin Harrison of Albumism described the song as "classic Motown" in his retrospective review of Flowers. He added that Ace of Base "showcase their expertise at branching out." AllMusic editor Bryan Buss called it a "'50s throwback". Chuck Campbell from The Daily News wrote that "Always Have Always Will" "bask in an affable warmth never before divulged by the cold Swedes." Gary Shipes from The Stuart News noted that "the faux Motown bounce of the teen-idol homage Donnie and Always Have Always Will, with their sterling sawing 
strings and crystalline melodies, are begging to be blasting out of car radios everywhere."
