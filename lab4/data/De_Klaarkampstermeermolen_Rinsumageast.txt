De Klaarkampstermeermolen is what the Dutch describe as a Grondzeiler. It is a two storey smock mill on a single storey base. There is no stage, the sails reaching almost to ground level. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The smock and cap are thatched. The sails are Common sails. They have a span of 16.14 metres (52 ft 11 in). The sails are carried on a cast iron windshaft, which was cast by Gieterij Hardinxveld of Hardinxveld-Giessendam, South Holland in 1991.  It also carries the brake wheel which has 47 cogs. This drives the wallower (24 cogs) at  the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft there are two crown wheels The upper crown wheel, which has 35 cogs drives an Archimedes' screw via a crown wheel. The lower crown wheel, which has 34 cogs is carried on the axle of an Archimedes' screw, which is used to drain the polder. The axle of the screw is 37 centimetres (1 ft 3 in) diameter and 5.15 metres (16 ft 11 in) long. The screw is 1.07 metres (3 ft 6 in) diameter. It is inclined at 25.7°.
