All Live and All of the Night is a live album by The Stranglers. The release peaked at No. 12 in the UK Albums Chart in March 1988.In 1986, The Stranglers played their first concerts for two years. By now the band were into their ninth studio album, Dreamtime, and had added a horn-section to the live presentation. The concerts from which tracks were taken span the period from April 1985 to August 1987. The live recording of "All Day and All of the Night" was dropped in favour of a "live" version specially recorded in the studio, as the true live recording was not considered to be up to the desired quality for this album.
