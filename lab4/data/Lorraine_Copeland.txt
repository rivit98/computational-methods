Lorraine Copeland (born Elizabeth Lorraine Adie, 1921–April 2013) was an archaeologist specialising in the Palaeolithic period of the Near East. She was a secret agent with the Special Operations Executive during World War II.


== Early life ==
In 1921, Copeland was born as Elizabeth Lorraine Adie in Scotland. Copeland's father was a neurosurgeon on Harley Street in London. Copeland was privately educated at Wycombe Abbey girls' school in Buckinghamshire.


== Special Operations Executive ==
Copeland worked for British Intelligence during the Second World War, in the Special Operations Executive. She met her American husband, Miles Copeland, Jr., during this period, when he was based in the UK undertaking counter-intelligence for the OSS (Office of Strategic Services). They married on 25 September 1942 and soon afterwards Miles' work took them to the Near East, particularly Syria, Lebanon and Egypt, and it was whilst in this area that Copeland first developed her interest in archaeology.

Copeland worked in the field of Palaeolithic archaeology for over fifty years, and was associated with the University College London Institute of Archaeology. She was an adviser to the Stone Age Institute. In 2004 the festschrift "From the River to the Sea: The Palaeolithic and the Neolithic on the Euphrates and in the Northern Levant " was published in her honour.
