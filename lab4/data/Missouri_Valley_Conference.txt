The Missouri Valley Conference (also called MVC or simply "The Valley") is the third-oldest collegiate athletic conference in the United States. Currently, its members are located in the midwestern United States.


== History ==
The MVC was founded in 1907 as the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association or MVIAA, 12 years after the Big Ten, the only Division I conference that is older. It is the third oldest college athletic conference in the United States, after the Big Ten conference and the NCAA Division III MIAA (Michigan Intercollegiate Athletics Association). In 1928 the MVIAA split and most of the larger schools formed a conference that retained the MVIAA name and ultimately became the Big Eight Conference.  The smaller schools, plus Oklahoma A&M (now Oklahoma State University–Stillwater, which joined the Big Eight in 1957), formed the MVC, which retained the old MVIAA's administrative staff. During the Big Eight's existence, both conferences claimed 1907 as their founding date. In 1996 the Big Eight merged with four Texas schools of the Southwest Conference to form the Big 12 Conference.During the 2006–07 college basketball season, MVC teams held a 74–27 non-conference record, including a record of 44–1 at home. The Valley finished in the top six of the RPI and ahead of a BCS conference for the second consecutive year, while also garnering multiple NCAA bids for the ninth straight year and 12th of 14.The MVC has not sponsored football since 1985, when it was a hybrid I-A/I-AA (now FBS and FCS), respectively.  However, five members have football programs in the Missouri Valley Football Conference (known as the Gateway from 1985 to 2008) of Division I FCS, and a sixth and a seventh compete in another FCS conference, the Pioneer Football League.  The Missouri Valley Conference shares its name with the Missouri Valley Football Conference, and the two also operate from the same headquarters complex in St. Louis.  However, the two are separate administratively.
After weeks of speculation, it was announced on April 7, 2017 that Wichita State would be leaving the conference to join the American Athletic Conference starting with the 2017–18 season. On May 9, 2017, the Conference announced it had extended an invitation to Valparaiso University, and on May 25, the MVC announced that Valparaiso would officially join the following July 1.

== Sports ==

The Missouri Valley Conference sponsors championship competition in seven men's and ten women's NCAA sanctioned sports. Dallas Baptist is an affiliate for baseball, Little Rock is an affiliate for swimming and diving, and Stony Brook is an affiliate in women's tennis.
The most recent change to the roster of sports was the dropping of men's tennis after the 2016–17 school year due to a lack of participating teams. Two of the four full conference members that sponsored the sport in that season no longer play men's tennis in the MVC. Southern Illinois dropped both men's and women's tennis, and Wichita State joined the American Athletic Conference. Affiliate member Stony Brook dropped men's tennis after the 2016–17 season. The two remaining MVC men's tennis schools from 2016–17, Drake and Illinois State, joined the Summit League for that sport, and incoming MVC member Valparaiso also joined the Summit League in men's tennis.

== Men's basketball attendance ==
Sources:The Valley is well known for having some of the most dedicated fanbases in all of college basketball, with several members regularly selling out their large arenas on a nightly basis throughout the year. Former member (Creighton) had the sixth highest attendance for Division I in 2012–13 while Bradley, Illinois State, Missouri State, and Indiana State were all among the NCAA's top 100 teams in home attendance.
In 2010–11, 2011–12, and 2012–13, the Valley maintained its position as the eighth ranked conference in average attendance.
The Valley made history in March 2007 with record attendance for four days at St. Louis' Scottrade Center as 85,074 fans turned out to watch the five sessions of the tournament.   The two sellout crowds of 22,612 for the semifinals and final of the 2007 State Farm Tournament set an all-time attendance record for basketball at the arena and also gave The Valley the distinction of having the largest championship crowd for any of the 30 NCAA conference tournaments in 2007.
