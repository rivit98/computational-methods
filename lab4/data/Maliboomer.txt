The Maliboomer was an attraction at the Paradise Pier section of Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. Manufactured by S&S Power, Mailboomer was a Space Shot attraction, meaning it launched guests from the bottom of the tower instead of slowly lifting them to the top and dropping them from there.  The ride was pneumatically powered, with three connected towers, each with its own independent ride system. It also contained "Scream Shields", used to block the screams from reaching residents of Anaheim and neighboring Garden Grove as the park is located near a residential area.
The concept of the Maliboomer came from a space-themed version of the High striker attraction on many boardwalks and carnivals. The Maliboomer name also hinted at this theme, since it alludes to the beach town of Malibu, California. 
As part of the park's multi-year, $1.1 billion expansion, the Maliboomer was originally planned to be remodeled, but it was later announced that the ride would not survive the park's expansion. The ride's last operating day was September 7, 2010 and the dismantling of the attraction began shortly afterwards.On June 28, 2019, the Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind attraction, inspired by DisneyÂ·Pixar's Inside Out, opened in the space where the Maliboomer once stood.
