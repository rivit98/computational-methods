== Career ==
Esteban Harrington was a prolific architect. He did considerable work in the Buenos Aires city. Most of the quantum was produced Harrington and his works have contributed much to giving character to the port and to the value of its architecture.
With offices in Valparaiso and Santiago with his brother Richard, the business greatly benefited from the critical situation created by the earthquake in Valparaiso in 1906. Thanks to the "perfect seismic performance of buildings designed and built" by them, they did work on public buildings, commercial and office buildings, in addition to many houses in the hills of Alegre, Concepcion, and the great British avenue of Cerro Playa Ancha.
His work is characterized by the adaptation of the style of Victorian architecture to the topography of Valparaiso, as part of a formal language similar to the Colonial Victorian construction styles used in San Francisco, Auckland, Sydney and Wellington.
Many of the buildings and houses that he designed are still adorning Valparaiso, full of class, charm, elegance and structural quality.
After being hit by a tram, Esteban Harrington died in 1936.
