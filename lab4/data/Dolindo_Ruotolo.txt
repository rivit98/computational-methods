Dolindo Ruotolo (6 October 1882, Naples, Italyâ€“19 November 1970, Naples, Italy) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest. He is a candidate for beatification and the Catholic Church has granted him the title "Servant of God".In 1941, Ruotolo, writing under the pseudonym of "Dain Cohenel", distributed to the Italian Catholic bishops a pamphlet attacking Catholic biblical scholarship, Un gravissimo pericolo per la Chiesa e per le anime. II sistema critico-scientifico nello studio e nell'interpretazione della Sacra Scrittura, le sue deviazioni funeste e le sue aberrazioni for which he was censured by the Pontifical Biblical Commission. He accused historical-critical methods of biblical interpretation of being the product of an "accursed spirit of pride, presumption, and superficiality, disguised under minute investigations and hypocritical literal exactness".Ruotolo authored a ten-thousand page Bible commentary, La Sacra Scrittura, which on 20 November 1940 was placed on the Index of Forbidden Books.Ruotolo has been recognized as an advocate of spiritual practice called the "spirituality of surrender". Polish Archbishop Konrad Krajewski, the Papal Almoner, has cited Ruotolo's personal devotion as an inspiration.
