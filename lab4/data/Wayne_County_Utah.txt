Wayne County is a county in the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2010 census, the population was 2,778, making it the fourth-least populous county in Utah. Its county seat is Loa.


== History ==
Due to its remoteness and harsh terrain, settlements did not appear in the future Wayne County until the 1880s. By 1892, there was enough settlement and enough interest in a separate county (due mainly to the difficulty of accessing the Piute County seat), that Utah Territory passed an act (effective date March 10, 1892) to separate the east portion of Piute into a separate county. It was named by a delegate to the constitutional convention, who said it was in memory of Wayne County, Tennessee. The county boundaries have remained unchanged since its creation.


== Geography ==
The eastern border of Wayne County is delineated by the meanders of the Green River, which flows southward to discharge into the Colorado River. After the two rivers join, the combined southwestern flow forms the remaining portion of the county's east border. The central part of the county is drained by the Fremont River and Muddy Creek. The Fremont begins at Fish Lake in Sevier County and flows into Wayne County near its NW corner. It joins the Muddy near Hanksville to form the Dirty Devil River, which flows southeastward out of the county's south border to discharge into the Colorado. Wayne County terrain varies from rough forestland on the west, to arid poor soil carved by drainages and rocky outcrops. The terrain slopes to the east and south; its highest area is near its NW corner, at 9,888' (3014m) ASL. The county has a total area of 2,466 square miles (6,390 km2), of which 2,461 square miles (6,370 km2) is land and 5.8 square miles (15 km2) (0.2%) is water.The Green River, passing through the canyons of Canyonlands National Park, forms the eastern boundary. The San Rafael Desert occupies the center of the county. Thousand Lake Mountain and Boulder Mountain flank Rabbit Valley on the western end of the county, where beautiful forests contrast with the deserts to the east. The small population of the county is centered in Rabbit Valley, with one town of 200, Hanksville, located in Graves Valley North of the Henry Mountains. Wayne County is also home of Capitol Reef National Park.
