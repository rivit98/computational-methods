Sexy Versus is the third studio album by Al B. Sure! It was his first album released exclusively by Warner Bros. Records, his first two having been released under Uptown Records with Warner Bros. Records handling distribution.
It was not as successful as his previous two albums but still managed to find success on the charts, making it to #41 on the Billboard 200 and #2 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. Three singles made it to the Billboard charts: "Natalie," "Right Now," and "I Don't Wanna Cry."
The track "See The Lady" is a remix of the song "Channel J" from his previous album Private Times...and the Whole 9!. The album's second single "Natalie" was written about actress Halle Berry after he saw her in the 1991 film Strictly Business. In 2014, Sure! referred to the success of the album as well as Berry's inspiration for "Natalie" on Twitter.It was recently revealed that one of the photos inside the booklet of this album in CD format is of Al B Sure! and his ex, Kim Porter, who died on November 16, 2018.
