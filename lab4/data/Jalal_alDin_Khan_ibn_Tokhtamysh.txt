Jalal al-Din Khan ibn Tokhtamysh (Urdu; Persian; Arabic: جلال الدین خان ابن تقتمش; Tatar: Cäläletdin, Polish: Dżalal ad-Din) (1380–1412) was the Khan of the Golden Horde in 1411–1412. He was the son of Tokhtamysh, Khan of the Golden Horde until 1395. He is also famous for his written history of the Mongol Empire. He is also known as the Green Sultan.


== Life ==
Tokhtamysh tried to regain his Khanate with Lithuanian aid, but was defeated in 1399. He continued his campaign until he died c. 1405. Jalal al-Din then fled to Lithuania. He too sought assistance from the Lithuanian Grand Prince Vytautas the Great. In 1410, he fought under Vytautas in the victory at Grunwald against the Teutonic Order.The next year, while Edigu (the real power in the Khanate) was in Khwarezm, Jalal al-Din returned to the Golden Horde. With Lithuanian support, he overthrew Khan Temur (son of Temur Qutlugh), and retook the throne of Sarai. Sometime after 1411 he minted coins bearing his name. According to a Russian chronicle, Jalal reigned for about a year, until he was murdered by his brother Karim Berdi.
