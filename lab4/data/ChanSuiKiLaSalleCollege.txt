Chan Sui Ki (La Salle) College (Traditional Chinese: 陳瑞祺(喇沙)書院; also abbreviated as CSK/CSKLSC and sometimes known as Chan Sui Ki (La Salle) College), is an Anglo-Chinese boys' secondary school in Homantin of Kowloon, Hong Kong, and was established in 1969 by the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, a Roman Catholic religious teaching order.


== History ==
In April 1967, the Chan family approached the Jesuits to ask if they would be interested in taking over the running of a secondary school to the building of which they intended to contributing and in memory of their father Mr. Chan Sui Ki, a successful merchant and once the President of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, one of the well-known charity organizations in Hong Kong. Not wishing to accept the offer themselves, Fr. Cronin, the Provincial, proposed the offer to the La Salle Brothers. Eventually, it was decided that La Salle College accepts the offer and transfers the existing evening school operating in La Salle College to the new building. The evening school under the supervision of Brother Herman Fenton operated from 3:00 until about 8:00 p.m. The government would provide the site and an 80% subsidy. The Chan family would donate HK$500,000.
In December 1968, work began on the site. In April 1969 the foundation stone was laid by the then Director of Education, Mr. Gregg, and on 3 September the school moved into the classroom block—951 students and 34 teachers all told. All the while work on the school hall and the laboratories, library, geography, art-room, etc. and the Brothers' quarters (which unhappily provide an accommodation for only four) continued until 12 December when the building authority inspected the completed building in preparation for giving the final occupation permit. The official blessing and opening ceremony was performed on 12 February 1970 by Rev. Father Colombo P. P. and the Hon. J. Canning, Director of Education, respectively.
The community was inaugurated on 1 July 1969 when Brother Herman Fenton, Director and Brother Eugene Sharkey were appointed to the new school. Later they were joined by Brothers Cronan and Paul Hackett. Until the Brothers quarters were ready the community continued to reside in La Salle College.


=== Dedication ===
The school is named by descendants of Mr. Chan Sui Ki, who at same time put up more than twenty free schools in Hong Kong and Macau, Canton, Foshan and elsewhere in memory of their father.
In 1936 Chan received the "Golden Dragon" medal from the Vietnamese Government in recognition of the help he had given in their troublesome times. On several occasions he sent donations to Northern China, Canton and Hong Kong and for years he distributed free rice to the needy of Macau.
