Tasmania's offshore islands: seabirds and other natural features is a book published by the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery in 2001. The book is considered an essential measure of the state of Tasmania's islands, birds inhabiting them, and the condition of the islands. The main author was Nigel Brothers, a Hobart based biologist, the other contributors were Vanessa Halley, Helen Pryor,  and David Pemberton.
The Tasmanian archipelago is made up of 334 islands. This book highlights the uniqueness and importance of 280, as significant breeding refuges and wealthy natural resources. Islands are documented with descriptions of topography, wildlife, vegetation and full-colour photographs."
