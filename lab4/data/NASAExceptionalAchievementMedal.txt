The NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal is an award of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration established in 1991.  The medal is awarded to both civilian members of NASA and military astronauts.
To be awarded the medal, a NASA employee must make substantial contributions characterized by a substantial and significant improvement in operations, efficiency, service, financial savings, science, or technology which directly contribute to the mission of NASA.  For civilians, the decoration is typically bestowed to mid-level and senior NASA administrators who have supervised at least four to five successful NASA missions.  Astronauts may be awarded the decoration after two to three space flights.
Due to its prestige, the medal is authorized as a military decoration for display on active duty military uniforms upon application from the service member to the various branch of the military in which they serve.
