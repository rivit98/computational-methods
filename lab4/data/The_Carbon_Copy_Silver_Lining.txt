The Carbon Copy Silver Lining is the independent debut album of the Texas-based progressive rock band Fair to Midland. It was recorded in January 2001, but released a year later independently. The album was reissued in late 2011 in a very limited run, as a part of pre-order bundles for the band's first DVD release, "Welcome to the Dirt".
