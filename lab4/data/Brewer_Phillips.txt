Brewer Phillips (November 16, 1924 â€“ August 30, 1999) was an American blues guitarist, chiefly associated with juke joint blues and Chicago blues.
Phillips was born on a plantation in Coila, Mississippi and learned the blues from Memphis Minnie at an early age. He relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, and played with Bill Harvey, Roosevelt Sykes, and Hound Dog Taylor. Following Taylor's death in 1976, Phillips recorded under his own name and also performed with J. B. Hutto, Lil' Ed Williams, and Cub Koda, among others, playing both acoustic and electric guitar. He recorded for Delmark Records and JSP Records.
Phillips died of natural causes in Chicago in August 1999, at the age of 74.
