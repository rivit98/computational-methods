Woods played in 49 career games for Oklahoma State, excelling first as a quarterback, and then as a safety after converting positions during the middle of the 2005 season. He was named Defensive MVP of the 2007 Insight Bowl during his senior season and also set an OSU freshman record with 13 touchdown passes in 2004. He majored in general business.
