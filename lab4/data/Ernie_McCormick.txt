Ernest Leslie McCormick (16 May 1906 – 28 June 1991) was an Australian cricketer who played in 12 Tests from 1935 to 1938.
McCormick was an instrument-maker and jeweller. After the 1960–61 West Indies tour of Australia, Donald Bradman and the Australian Cricket Board of Control commissioned McCormick to create a perpetual trophy for winners of Test match series between the two teams. Its design incorporated a ball used in the tied Test and the Frank Worrell Trophy was named in honour of the West Indies captain.
