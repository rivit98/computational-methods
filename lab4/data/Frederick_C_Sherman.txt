Frederick Carl Sherman (May 27, 1888 – July 27, 1957) was a highly decorated admiral of the United States Navy during World War II.


== Early life ==
Sherman was born in Port Huron, Michigan on May 27, 1888. His grandfather, Loren Sherman, was the longtime editor and publisher of The Daily Times in Port Huron. His father, Frederick Ward Sherman, sold the newspaper in 1907 and moved to California, where he was editor and publisher of The Daily Independent in Santa Barbara in 1911.

Sherman graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1910. He served as commanding officer of submarines USS H-2 (SS-29) and USS O-7 (SS-68) during World War I.
After becoming a naval aviator, Sherman served as executive officer of USS Saratoga (CV-3) in 1937, and of Naval Air Station San Diego to 1938. He commanded USS Lexington (CV-2) from 1940 until her loss in the Battle of the Coral Sea. His wife wrote a book titled Admiral Wags which told the story of the family cocker spaniel who accompanied Sherman during his command of Lexington. The dog can be seen in war footage used in the John Wayne movie In Harm's Way. Promoted to rear admiral, he served as assistant chief of staff to Commander in Chief Atlantic Fleet, Admiral Ernest King until the end of 1942. He served in the Fast Carrier Task Force, as Commander, Carrier Division 2 in 1943, and as Commander, Task Group 38.3 in 1944–45.
Sherman was a three-time recipient of the Navy Cross. Promoted to vice admiral in 1945, he became Commander, United States Fifth Fleet before retiring in 1947. Upon retirement, he was promoted to admiral on the retired list.
