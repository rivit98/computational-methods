The Boulevard de la Bastille is the southwestern-most street of the 12th arrondissement of Paris, situated in the quartier called Quinze-Vingts. It overlooks the east side of the Paris marina, known as the Port de Plaisance or  Port de l'Arsenal, with which it forms a boundary with the 4th arrondissement of Paris. (The Port de l'Arsenal is in fact the terminus of the Canal Saint-Martin, which begins at the Place de Stalingrad.) The boulevard also lies directly north (across the Seine) of the border between the 5th arrondissement and the 13th arrondissement of Paris.
