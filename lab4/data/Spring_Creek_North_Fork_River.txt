The stream is entirely within the Mark Twain National Forest.
The stream flows west-southwest passing under Missouri Route AP and enters Douglas County just southeast of the Noblett Lake Recreation Area and receives the flow of Noblett Creek as it turns to the south-southwest. The stream is fed by numerous springs as it flows past the community of Roosevelt.
