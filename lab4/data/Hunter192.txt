It has a fractional sloop rig, a slightly raked stem, a walk-through reverse transom, a transom-hung kick-up rudder controlled by a tiller, a retractable centerboard and a flooding water ballast tank, which is drained for road transport. It displaces 2,000 lb (907 kg) when the 500 lb (227 kg)-capacity water ballast tank is full and 1,500 lb (680 kg) with it empty.The boat has a draft of 4.67 ft (1.42 m) with the centreboard extended and 1.17 ft (0.36 m) with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer.The boat is normally fitted with a small outboard motor for docking and maneuvering. The design features a self-bailing cockpit, built-in outboard engine mount, a portable toilet, portable stove and a cooler. The fresh water tank has a capacity of 2.3 U.S. gallons (8.7 L; 1.9 imp gal). A highway trailer was supplied as standard equipment.The design has a hull speed of 5.35 kn (9.91 km/h).
