== Sample of research projects ==


=== Speech communication ===
APPSy (Asymétries Phonétique et Phonologique de la Syllabe, i.e., Phonetic and Phonological Asymmetries in the Syllable), funded by Agence nationale de la recherche. In partnership with GIPSA-lab, LIDILEM, LIG, LPP and Phonolab-ULB/LSP (Belgium). Aim: to explore the links between mandibular gestures and syllabic structures, on the basis of a sample of languages with widely different syllable types and consonantal inventories: Tashlhiyt Berber, French, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Kinyarwanda, Ruwund, and Vietnamese.
AuCo (Audio Corpora). Aim: to put together an open-access collection of recordings of languages of Vietnam and neighbouring countries. In partnership with the Pangloss Collection (CNRS-LACITO) and SLDR (CNRS-LPL). AuCo stands for AudioCorpora; it is also a reference to Âu Cơ, a fairy who is mother to the Hundred Peoples (Bách Việt), ancestor to the Vietnamese and to the multitude of other ethnic groups of the area.

=== Pervasive spaces ===
VIPPA (Visually Impaired People Assistance using multimodal technologies). Aim: providing a framework for aiding blind pupils in their collective life in a school campus to navigate with safety in indoor and outdoor environments and to improve their perception about contextual information. Project conducted within the framework of the Vietnam-Belgium programme VLIR, in partnership with IMEP-LAHC (France), LIG/PRIMA (France), Image Processing and Interpretation Research Groupe, Ghent University (Belgium), and Danang University (Vietnam).
SYSAPA (Système de surveillance pour l'assistance des personnes aveugles en environnement perceptifs). Project conducted in the framework of the Vietnamese-French programme Hoa Sen/Lotus, in partnership with IMEP-LAHC.


=== Multimedia ===
ICT-PAMM (Personal Assistance for Mobility and Manipulation). Project conducted in the framework of the 2010/2011 STIC-ASIE programme, in partnership with INRIA, LASMEA, Sungkyunhkwan University (Korea), NTU (Taiwan), and Kumamoto University (Japan).
