His influence did much to get clinical pharmacology accepted as a specialty in its own right in Britain.
He encouraged the formation of new departments of clinical pharmacology. ... Clinicians, he felt, needed to know more of the problems of industry, and industry needed better methods of assessing the safety and efficacy of drugs. With support from GD Searle Ltd he created a new post in his department for a clinician working part-time in industry and part-time in academic medicine.
His home in Glasgow was in Westbourne Gardens in the Hyndland district. He also had a holiday cottage near Loch Sunart.He died in Glasgow of a long and painful illness on 15 April 1977 a few hours before his 60th birthday.
