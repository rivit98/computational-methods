== History ==
Wasteland began in 1994 in Amsterdam. Its main goal was to bring fetishism out of the underground and expose it to a wider audience. Open-mindedness and tolerance are still key elements during this event. Outrageous partying gay, straight and bi-sexual fetishists caused commotion in the city of Amsterdam. It was something that had been seen never before. There was a gangway build between Club Richter and Cafe Blitz in the Reguliersdwarsstraat for the event. The beautifully dressed guests could be admired by passersby from the street. Pictures of this were shared all over the world.
