Bāng Chhun-hong is a Taiwanese Hokkien song composed by Teng Yu-hsien, a Hakka Taiwanese musician, and written by Lee Lin-chiu. The song was one of their representative works. It was released by the Columbia Records in 1933, and originally sung by some female singers at that time, such as Sun-Sun, Ai-Ai (愛愛) or Iam-Iam (艷艷). The title literally means "Longing for the Spring Breeze".
Bāng Chhun-hong was once adapted into a Japanese patriotic song as "Daichi wa maneku" (Japanese: 大地は招く), literally means "The Mother Earth is Calling on You". It was re-written by Koshiji Shirou (越路詩郎) and sung by Kirishima Noboru (霧島昇). The song has also been released in Japan by Hitoto Yo, a Japanese pop singer. Many Taiwanese singers have covered the song, such as Teresa Teng, Showlen Maya, Feng Fei-fei, Stella Chang (張清芳), and David Tao.
Since song's publication, films with similar names have been released, such as the 1937 film directed by Andou Tarou (安藤太郎), and a 1977 film which has an English name of "The Operations of Spring Wind". Bāng Chhun-hong has frequently been used as background music in Taiwanese films or teleplays. It is also a theme in the soundtrack of Singapore Dreaming, a 2006 released Singaporean film.
There is a biographical novel of the same name that written by Chung Chao-cheng, a Hakka writer. The novel does not describe about the song, instead, it depicts the life of Teng Yu-hsien, the composer.
