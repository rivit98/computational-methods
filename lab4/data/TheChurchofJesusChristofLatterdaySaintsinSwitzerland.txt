Missionary work for LDS Church began in Switzerland on November 24, 1850 when the Swiss Mission was created. The Swiss Mission later became the Swiss and Italian Mission and the Swiss, Italian, and German Mission. Many early converts were baptized, but then emigrated to the United States until the 1950s.
On September 11, 1955 the LDS Church completed the first LDS Church temple in Europe when the Bern Switzerland Temple was completed in Zollikofen. The temple was later remodeled and rededicated by Gordon B. Hinckley in October 1992. In 1994, Howard W. Hunter visited Switzerland as the new LDS Church president.Hans B. Ringger was a Swiss national who was a leader of the LDS Church in Switzerland. Born on 2 November 1925, in Zurich, Switzerland, his grandmother, Elizabeth Zoebeli Ringger, joined the Church in 1896 and his parents, Carl Ringger, Jr., and Maria Reif, were also active members.
