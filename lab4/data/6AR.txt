== Early history ==


=== WAAMA ===
The Western Australian Aboriginal Media Association (WAAMA) was founded in 1988 as an Aboriginal Corporation with the aim of promoting Aboriginal culture. WAAMA provided programming for a number of media outlets, most notably for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and 6NR.


=== Broadcasters ===
Mark Bin Bakar, better known for his alter-ego Mary G, was an early WAAMA announcer. In the late 1990s Narelda Jacobs, currently a news anchor with Network Ten, was a broadcaster with 6AR.


== Broadcasting ==
Radio 6AR was launched in 1994 and broadcast from facilities in Wellington Street, Perth. The station initially broadcast on the AM band at 1170 kHz. As well as providing news and music programming, 6AR broadcast a range of sporting programs including syndicated AFL and NRL coverage through the National Indigenous Radio Service. They were represented at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.

== Cancellation of licence ==
In May 2006 the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) conducted an investigation into 6AR and found that the station had breached their licence conditions. ACMA found that between August 2003 and April 2005 conditions relating to providing Aboriginal programming were not met.In September 2006 6AR ceased broadcasting and the Office of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations began proceedings to wind up WAAMA. The Australian newspaper raised the issue of the October 2005 transfer of the station's premises to a private company and the subsequent lease back to WAAMA.In November 2006 ACMA cancelled 6AR's licence for failing to comply with licence conditions added as a result of the May 2006 findings.ACMA in January 2008 allocated the vacant 100.9 FM frequency to a group led by Peedac Pty Ltd who proposed a replacement Aboriginal radio service for Perth, 6NME.
