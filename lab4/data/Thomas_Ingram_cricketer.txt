Thomas Ingram (dates unknown) was an English cricketer of the late 18th century.  He was a left-handed batsman and a wicketkeeper.  
According to Scores and Biographies, Ingram was for a time a victualler at Cobham in Surrey.  His career began with Surrey but from the 1791 season he played for Essex, having apparently joined the famous Hornchurch Cricket Club.
Ingram's best performance as a keeper was in the Kent v Essex match at Dartford Brent in August 1792 when he took five catches and made three stumpings for Essex, which was to no avail as Kent won by 81 runs.
Thomas Ingram made 24 known appearances in major matches between 1787 and 1798.
