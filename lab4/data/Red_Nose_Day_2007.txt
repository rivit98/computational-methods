=== Stash of Celebrity Swag ===
Justin Lee Collins and Alan Carr raid a celebrity's mansion in an updated version of Through the Keyhole and steal some of their belongings. Viewers can call in to win the bag of swag if they can guess, from the really obvious clues, who the swag belongs too. This phone-in competition was later subject to an investigation in which it was revealed the winner was faked. After the first two genuine callers got the answer wrong the queue was lost. After a delay the third caller and subsequent winner was faked by a crew member.In the lead up to Red Nose Day many different fund raising events occurred:

Beginning Friday 9 March 2007, the BBC Radio 1 breakfast team staged a tour around the UK entitled The Chris Moyles Rallyoke.  The tour involved seven Karaoke nights held in a well known UK location featuring members of the public and well known celebrities and music artists.  Most Radio 1 shows report on their progress, and hold competitions to win tickets to be at the final on Red Nose Day, and also to win the contents of a truck donated by various celebrities.  As well as raising money at each event, the profit of the phone-in competitions go to Comic Relief making a total of £600,000
Televised events included a third series of Comic Relief Does Fame Academy, and a celebrity version of The Apprentice entitled Comic Relief Does The Apprentice has also been screened.  Also a special hybrid of Top of the Pops and Top Gear titled Top Gear of the Pops was made for Red Nose Day.  It featured its presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May singing with Justin Hawkins, as well as Top Gear segments such as The Cool Wall.
Fund raising merchandise sold during the 2007 campaign included the Big One (Red Nose) itself, 'Walkears', an Andrex Puppy with a red nose, a special Little Britain Live DVD and the official single, which was a cover of Aerosmith's 'Walk This Way' sung by Girls Aloud and Sugababes.
The last episode of the Vicar of Dibley was aired as part of the show, starring the usual cast.  It featured Sting taking part with a celebrity and non-entity television show, swapping wives with the vicar's husband Harry.
The special Little Britain Live featured famous people such as: Dennis Waterman, Chris Moyles, Jonathan Ross, Kate Moss and Russell Brand.  Kate Moss played a chav, Russell Brand played a transvestite, and both Chris Moyles and Jonathan Ross were brought on as either small parts, or people who came up to the audience to be embarrassed.
There were several sketches from Catherine Tate: in which David Tennant (who she would work with again a year later in Doctor Who, which is referenced to & joked about within the sketch) became a school teacher; Daniel Craig fell in love with Tate; mouthy teenager Lauren was given work experience at 10 Downing Street, leading to Tony Blair using her catchphrase "Am I bovvered?"; and foul-mouthed "Nan" appeared with Noel Edmonds on Deal or No Deal.
To gain additional money, Peter Kay and Matt Lucas released a cover of The Proclaimers hit, I'm Gonna Be, and released it as a single 'I Would Roll (500 Miles)' (both were playing wheelchair bound characters from Little Britain and Phoenix Nights).  It also featured numerous celebrity guests.
There was also a live show from The Mighty Boosh.
