Polonium hexafluoride (PoF6) is a possible chemical compound of polonium and fluorine and one of the seventeen known binary hexafluorides.


== Synthesis ==
The synthesis of PoF6 via the reaction

210Po + 3 F2 → 210PoF6was attempted in 1945, but the attempt was unsuccessful. The boiling point was predicted to be about −40 °C.208PoF6 was probably successfully synthesised via the same reaction in 1960 with the more stable isotope 208Po, where a volatile polonium fluoride was produced, but it was not fully characterized before it underwent radiolysis and decomposed to polonium tetrafluoride.
