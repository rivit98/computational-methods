Referred to by the media and his fans as \"Action King\" for his roles in action films, he works predominantly in Tamil, Kannada and Telugu language films, while also performing in a few Malayalam and Hindi films. As of 2017, Arjun had acted in more than 150 movies. Until his 150th film, he has mostly performed in lead roles and is one of few South Indian actors to attract fan following from multiple states of India. He has directed 11 films and also produced and distributed a number of films..\n",
      "In 1993, he starred in S. Shankar's blockbuster Gentleman which opened to positive reviews, while Arjun went on to win the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor. During this time, he starred in hits such as Jai Hind (1994), Karnaa (1995), and the action thriller film Kurudhipunal (1995), for which Arjun won acclaim for his role while the film became India's official entry for the 68th Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category.In 1999, he starred in the political action-thriller Mudhalvan (1999). Portraying an ambitious TV journalist who receives the opportunity to become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for a day, Arjun offered bulk dates for filming the project to Shankar. The film subsequently won positive reviews with Arjun described as having \"acquitted himself with aplomb in the challenging role\". \n",
      "Arjun received the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor for his role as well as numerous other nominations. Arjun then briefly experimented in softer roles with Kannodu Kanbathellam (1999) and as an energetic civil service officer in Vaanavil (2000).\n",
      "He was then featured in Vasanth's romantic drama film Rhythm, where he played a photographer, who eventually falls in love with a widow. Featuring a popular soundtrack and opening to positive reviews, Rhythm also became a commercial success. He carried on with a lighter theme in his next directorial venture, the love story Vedham (2001), while he ventured into Telugu cinema again by appearing in Raja's Hanuman Junction and the Kannada devotional film Sri Manjunatha (2001). In 2012, he appeared in the Kannada film Prasad screened at the Berlin Film Festival. Arjun won the Karnataka State Film Award for Best Actor for his work in the film. Jaihind 2 in Tamil and Telugu, Abhimanyu in Kannada is a 2014 Indian multilingual action-masala film produced and directed by Arjun.

      "Arjun Sarja was born as Srinivasa Sarja on 15 August 1964, in Madhugiri, in the erstwhile Mysore State. His father was Shakthi Prasad, a Kannada film actor, and his mother was Lakshmi, an art teacher. He had one elder brother Kishore Sarja, who directed Kannada films. He is married to Niveditha Arjun a former actress who has appeared in the 1986 Kannada film Ratha Sapthami under the stage name of Asha Rani. Kannada actor Rajesh is his father-in-law. Sarja has two daughters, Aishwarya and Anjana. Aishwarya Arjun made her acting debut in 2013. His nephews Chiranjeevi Sarja and Dhruva Sarja both act in Kannada movies. Another nephew of Arjun, Bharat Sarja, will also be making his acting debut in 2013.Sarja, inspired by Bruce Lee's 1973 film Enter the Dragon, began training Karate at the age of 16 and now holds a black belt.\n",

He is building the Hanuman temple at the outskirts of Chennai. A 35-foot statue of the Lord Anjaneya was sculpted exclusively for the temple and the statue of the Hanuman is in a sitting posture and weighs around 140 tonnes.

      "Arjun's father Shakti Prasad, a renowned actor of Kannada films, did not want his son to become an actor and turned down film offers that Arjun began to receive as a teenager. In a surprise move, film producer Rajendra Singh Babu managed to convince Arjun to begin shooting for a feature film for his production house without Shakti Prasad's express permission and consequently, his father agreed to Arjun's career choice. The film Simhada Mari Sainya (1981) featured him as a junior artiste and the director of the film gave him the stage name of Arjun, replacing his original name Ashok Babu. While he began to establish himself Kannada films, he received an offer from actor-producer A. V. M. Rajan and director Rama Narayanan to do a Tamil film Nandri. Simultaneously he was offered a Telugu film, Kodi Ramakrishna's Maa Pallelo Gopaludu in Telugu too which went on to be a big success, running for a year in three centers.\n",

      "=== 1989-1999: Breakthrough ===\n",
      "His career as an actor began to take off in the mid-1980s and he sometimes worked for up to seven shifts in a day to keep up with the films he had committed to do By 1990, his films lost box office value and he was out of work in Tamil and Telugu films for almost a year. He subsequently chose to direct his feature film Sevagan (1992), a crime story which opened to mixed reviews, but became a box office success. Soon after, Shankar cast him in the lead role in his first film, Gentleman, after much persuasion. Arjun had initially rejected the film without listening to Shankar's narration but the director's persistence prompted him to feature in the film as a vigilante against corruption. The film opened to positive reviews and went on to become a trendsetter in the Tamil film industry, as well as achieving significant box office success, while Arjun went on to win the State Award for Best Actor. His change of fortune at the box office continued and Arjun began to gain ground as a bankable lead star in action films after his films including his patriotic directorial venture Jai Hind (1994) and Karnaa (1995), where he played a dual role, went on to become blockbusters. Kamal Haasan approached Arjun to play a police officer in the drama film Kurudhipunal (1995), and the actor jumped at the opportunity and agreed to do the film even without hearing the narration. Arjun won positive acclaim for his role, while the film became India's official entry for the 68th Academy Awards Best Foreign Language Film category.In the late 1990s, his action films often carried a patriotic theme, though he was still able to attract prominent producers and directors. After a series of unsuccessful action films, including his own venture Thaayin Manikodi (1998). With the film Mannavaru Chinnavaru (1999), he acted his 100th film co-starred with Sivaji Ganesan and Soundarya in lead roles. Arjun then briefly experimented in softer roles, portraying critically acclaimed characters of businessman with \"shades of grey\" in Prabhu Solomon's Kannodu Kanbathellam (1999). He teamed up again with Shankar in the political drama film Mudhalvan (1999). Portraying an ambitious TV journalist who receives the opportunity to become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for a day, Arjun offered bulk dates for filming the project to Shankar. The film subsequently won positive reviews with Arjun described as having \"acquitted himself with aplomb in the challenging role\".

      "He play in the action film Sudhandhiram (2000), directed by Raj Kapoor. It is remake of Hindi film Ghulam. Later he plays a role as an energetic civil service officer in Vaanavil (2000). He then featured in Vasanth's romantic drama film Rhythm (2000), where he played a photographer, who eventually falls in love with another widower. Featuring a popular soundtrack and opening to positive reviews, Rhythm also became a commercial success, with a critic noting \"Arjun is as polished as ever\" and adding \"who would have conceived this idea that the \"Action King\" could attempt a soft-natured role of this kind\". He carried on with a lighter theme in his next directorial venture, the love story Vedham (2001), while he ventured into Telugu cinema again by appearing in Raja's Hanuman Junction and as a Hindu devotee in Sri Manjunatha (2001).\n",
      "The image of \"action king\" made him popular with town and village centre audiences, who appreciate the actor's fight and stunt scenes. He thus actively chose to specialise in action films, often collaborating with directors who specialised in them such as Sundar C, Venkatesh and Selva. In the mid 2000s, he appeared in several action films with the same premise, often portraying a police officer or a local do-gooder. He directed and featured in lead roles in both the action films Ezhumalai (2002) and Parasuram (2003), while also being involved in Maharajan's Arasatchi (2004). Some of his films, Giri (2004) and Marudhamalai, were box office successes, with several of his projects were not, including Madrasi, Vathiyar (2006) and Durai, in all of which he was the story writer. Despite not achieving any significant hit films in the 2000s, producers often considered Arjun as a \"minimum guarantee\" actor and felt his sizable fan following the four Southern States of India would help recover money even through dubbed versions. In a rare experimental film for him in the decade, he portrayed the role of the Hindu deity Hanuman in Krishna Vamsi's devotional film Sri Anjaneyam (2004) and worked on the film without receiving remuneration as a self-confessed worshipper of the deity. He was also cast for a change as a realistic police officer in Bharathiraja's critically acclaimed Bommalattam (2008), where a reviewer felt his \"showcase of the soft, subtle yet unrelenting cop was noteworthy\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 2010-2017: Various roles ===\n",
      "Since the turn of the decade, Arjun has attempted to move away from his \"action king\" image and accepted to star in films where he would play the antagonist or a supporting role, with the move drawing praise from film critics. In 2011, Arjun accepted the opportunity to play an extended guest role alongside Ajith Kumar in Venkat Prabhu's action thriller Mankatha, with critics praising his performance as a Police officer in the blockbuster. The following year he appeared in Kannada film Prasad, for which he won the Karnataka State Film Award for Best Actor. Portraying a middle-class father with a deaf and dumb son, Arjun noted it was a rewarding experience for him to break the monotony of his standard roles and attempt something different, admitting he was moved by the script. The film opened to unanimously positive reviews in March 2012 and then was selected to be screened at the Berlin Film Festival, with critics labelling Arjun's portrayal as a \"stunning performance\" and his \"career best\". Arjun collaborated with  Mani Ratnam with Kadal (2013), in which the actor portrayed a negative role of a smuggler in coastal Tamil Nadu. While the film opened to mixed reviews and became a box office failure, Arjun won rave reviews for his portrayal with Sify.com noting Arjun is \"deliciously despicable in his career's most memorable negative role\" and The Hindu labelling him as \"brilliant\". He then won acclaim for his portrayal of real-life police officer K. Vijay Kumar in the bilingual film Vana Yuddham, the biopic of notorious forest brigand Veerappan, as well as for his role of a paralysed swimming coach in Vasanth's romance film, Moondru Per Moondru Kadal.His latest directorial venture, Jai Hind 2 contained a message about the declining state of the Indian education system. The film became a box office success in Kannada, while the Tamil version did not perform well at the box office. In 2016, he acted in Kannada film, Game. It was released in Tamil as Oru Melliya Kodu. The film has some good performances. Arjun and Shaam, both Bengaluru boys but doing Tamil films, are apt for their roles. The Kannada and Tamil version was a Hit at the box office. In 2017, he marks in his 150th film Nibunan. It was simultaneously released in Kannada as Vismaya. Arjun looks stylish and suave as the fit and honest officer, and he excels in a couple of action blocks he gets. Varalaxmi and Prasanna have enough space for their roles and are as good as the protagonist's aides. 'Nibunan; is indeed worth your money and time for it retains the suspense element for a predominant part, there are a lot of interesting ideas and of course Arjun. These two versions is delivered on 28 July to positive reviews.\n",

      "In 2018, he directed in the Kannada-Tamil movie Prema Baraha. The film stars Chandan Kumar and his daughter Aishwarya Arjun Prema Baraha has all the trademark elements of an Arjun Sarja film – stunts, patriotic fervor and a touch of devotion for Lord Hanuman. The movie was a success in Kannada. It was released in Tamil as Sollividava but did not have an impact in audience. He acted in Telegu Naa Peru Surya, Naa Illu India with Allu Arjun, followed by  Irumbu Thirai, a Tamil action movie co-starred with Vishal. Arjun play in the negative role. The film was a Blockbuster at the box office.Arjun's upcoming project is the Malayalam film Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham which stars an ensemble cast lead by Mohanlal.\n",

      "Hong Sang Soo (홍상수, born 25 October 1960) is a South Korean film director and screenwriter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Early life ==\n",
      "Hong Sang Soo's parents owned the film production company Cinetel Soul. Hong took the entrance exam and entered the theater department at Chung-Ang University in South Korea. He then studied in the United States where he received his bachelor's degree from the California College of Arts and Crafts and his master's at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Career ==\n",
      "Hong made his directorial debut at age 35 with The Day a Pig Fell into the Well in 1996. Woman is the Future of Man (2004) was his first film to screen in competition at the Cannes Film Festival.Hong's films have also screened at the Berlin International Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival, and the Locarno Film Festival.He has received the Prix Un Certain Regard at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival for Hahaha, the Silver Leopard Award for Best Director at the 2013 Locarno International Film Festival for Our Sunhi, and the Golden Leopard at the 2015 Locarno International Film Festival for Right Now, Wrong Then. His 2020 film The Woman Who Ran won him the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Film style ==\n",
      "There are certain elements that are commonly found in Hong's films. A typical Hong film highlights a theme of domestic realism with many of the scenes set on residential streets, cafes, hotels, schools, and in the stairwells of apartment buildings. Characters in the film are seen walking around the city, drinking soju, and having sex. The main characters in his films are often movie directors or actors, and scenes typically consist of a single shot, often beginning and ending with a camera zoom. The budgets for his movies average about $100,000.Hong is often spontaneous when shooting, delivering the day's scene on the morning of the shoot and frequently changing stories while on set. He rarely prepares scripts in advance. Hong instead begins with a basic guideline and writes his scenes on the morning of the filming day, making changes throughout the day. Hong starts the filming day at 4 a.m. when he begins to write the dialogue for that day's shoot. Hong also develops close relationships with the actors over alcohol and cigarettes and sometimes shoots certain scenes while the actors are under the influence.Hong's style has been compared to Eric Rohmer's, and it has even be argued that allusions to Rohmer's films appear in some films directed by Hong.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Personal life ==\n",
      "In 2016, Hong was reported to be having an extramarital affair with actress Kim Min-hee, who appeared in his 2015 film, Right Now, Wrong Then. Hong admitted to the affair in March 2017, at the Seoul premiere of On the Beach at Night Alone. He filed a divorce suit from his wife in December 2016, but the court rejected his request in June 2019, insisting that only the injured party, Hong's wife, could initiate a legal separation.\n",

      "United Goans Democratic Party (UGDP) is one of two formerly dominant political parties in the Indian state of Goa. UGDP has its base amongst the Christian part of the population. It was founded in 1983 by Churchill Alemao.\n",
      "In Goa, the UGDP is however not related to the old United Goans Party. The name United Goans Democratic Party is a mere spin-off of the name of the United Goans Party, and their election symbol of \"two leaves\" is a spin-off of the symbol of \"two leaves\" which was designated in the plebiscite to determine whether Goa should be independent, as against the rose symbol for voting Goa as a part of Maharashtra. The present United Goans Democratic Party had absolutely no role to play in the plebiscite to decide whether Goa should be a separate entity or not, but they continue to use the Two Leaves symbol and a name similar to that of the party which played a major role in ensuring that Goa remains distinct, the erstwhile United Goans Party. UDGP is much weaker than its claimed predecessor, the United Goans Party which was the main opposition party during the 1960s.\n",
      "At the June 2007 state elections, the party took one out of 40 seats. It was allied with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), while in opposition in Goa and in the national government.\n",
      "In the Assembly elections of 2012, the United Goans Democratic Party could not win a single seat, while its lone MLA from the previous election, Mr. Mathany Saldanha, contested and won on a BJP ticket.\n",
      "The United Goans Democratic Party and its founder Churchill Alemao (now in the NCP) along with his hand-picked three other family members were defeated in the hustings, causing the worst Congress defeat since the time when Congress first ruled Goa, almost thirty years ago. The present BJP government has rejected all attempts of the UGDP of showing that they are close to the present dispensation. The lone UGDP legislator from the last assembly Mr. Mathany Saldanha however, was rewarded for finally quitting the UGDP by having been allotted a prime ministry. After his untimely death, his widow is holding the responsibility.\n",
      "The UGDP in the meanwhile, has lost its recognition as a party and has also lost its right to ownership of the \"two leaves\" symbol.\n",
      "Its original leader though, went beyond using a name similar to the UGP (United Goans Party) and a symbol similar to Goa's Opinion Poll (plebiscite to determine whether Goa should be a separate identity). In the last elections he rode on the back of the Save Goa movement, a movement by various groups to save Goa from the badly prepared Regional Plan, and formed a party on ts own. His newly formed party won two seats, Navelim for himself and Curtorim for his protege Reginaldo Lourenco, under the name \"SAVE GOA FRONT\", a clear rip off of the Save Goa Movement which was ruling the press releases  at that time.\n",
      "At the end of the day, the UGDP is a party which takes up every issue that crops up before it. Its two supreme leaders Anacleto Viegas and Radharao Gracias always take up opposite stands, with one supporting the issue and the other opposing it.\n",

      "Paradox Access Solutions is the sole Canadian distributor of a product called Tough Cell, a Novel polymeric alloy cellular confinement product developed by PRS-Geo-Technologies known as Neology geocell.Once the honeycomb-shaped geotextile is placed, it's filled with sand, gravel, dirt, or other locally available materials, and then compressed. The honeycomb shape is able to support heavy equipment by redirecting downward energy outward, “decreasing differential settlement of soft subgrades,” providing soil confinement, stabilization, and reinforcement. The resulting surface is functional in very cold (-60C) to very hot (60C) conditions.The product is notable for its durability, and reduced cost and carbon footprint, resulting from the use of local, rather than imported, aggregate materials.In addition to temporary roadway applications, it has also been approved for municipal road construction projects.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Career ==\n",
      "Lahoud attended the University of New Haven, where he played college baseball for the New Haven Chargers.Lahoud played for the Winston-Salem Red Sox of the Class A Carolina League in 1966 and 1967. Though optioned to the minor leagues during spring training in 1968, the Red Sox recalled Lahoud from the Louisville Colonels of the Class AAA International League at the start of the 1968 season as Tony Conigliaro struggled with his recovery from an eye injury. He was soon sent to Louisville to continue his development. The Red Sox optioned Lahoud to Louisville at the end of spring training in 1970.On October 10, 1971, the Red Sox traded Lahoud to the Milwaukee Brewers with Ken Brett, Billy Conigliaro, Jim Lonborg, Don Pavletich, and George Scott for Tommy Harper, Lew Krausse, Marty Pattin, and minor leaguer Pat Skrable. On October 22, 1973, the Brewers traded Lahoud to the California Angels with Ollie Brown, Skip Lockwood, Ellie Rodriguez, and Gary Ryerson for Steve Barber, Ken Berry, Art Kusnyer, Clyde Wright, and cash. On June 14, 1976, the Texas Rangers acquired Lahoud from the Angels for \"slightly more than the waiver price\".In his career, Lahoud played in 791 games and had a .223 batting average with 65 home runs, 218 runs batted in, 429 hits, 239 runs scored, and a .372 slugging percentage. On June 11,1969, he hit 3 home runs in one game for the Red Sox. After his baseball career ended he became a successful executive in the facilities management industry. Joe resides in Litchfield County Connecticut. Married to a successful real estate agent Patrica Kennedy Lahoud.

      "Earth materials include minerals, rocks, soil and water. These are the naturally occurring materials found on Earth that constitute the raw materials upon which our global society exists. Earth materials are vital resources that provide the basic components for life, agriculture and industry. Earth materials can also include metals and precious rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Definitions ==\n",
      "The type of materials available locally will of course vary depending upon the conditions in the area of the building site. Take considerations of what is explained below.\n",
      "In many areas, indigenous stone is available from the local region, such as limestone, marble, granite, and sandstone. It may be cut in quarries or removed from the surface of the ground (flag and fieldstone). Ideally, stone from the building site can be utilized. Depending on the stone type, it can be used for structural block, facing block, pavers, and crushed stone.\n",
      "Most brick plants are located near the clay source they use to make brick. Bricks are molded and baked blocks of clay. Brick products come in many forms, including structural brick, face brick, roof tile, structural tile, paving brick, and floor tile.\n",
      "Caliche is a soft limestone material which is mined from areas with calcium-carbonate soils and limestone bedrock. It is best known as a road bed material, but it can be processed into an unfired building block, stabilized with an additive such as cement. Other earth materials include soil blocks typically stabilized with a cement additive and produced with forms or compression.\n",
      "Rammed Earth consists of walls made from moist, sandy soil, or stabilized soil, which is tamped into form work. Walls are a minimum of 12″ thick. Soils should contain about 30% clay and 70% sand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Considerations ==\n",
      "The use of locally available and indigenous earth materials has several advantages in terms of sustainability. They are:\n",
      "Reduction of energy costs related to transportation.\n",
      "Reduction of material costs due to reduced transportation costs, especially for well-established industries.\n",
      "Support of local businesses and resource bases.\n",
      "Care must be taken to ensure that non-renewable earth materials are not over-extracted. Ecological balance within the region needs to be maintained while efficiently utilizing its resources. Many local suppliers carry materials that have been shipped in from out of the area, so it is important to ask for locally produced/quarried materials.\n",
      "Both brick and stone materials are aesthetically pleasing, durable, and low maintenance. Exterior walls weather well, eliminating the need for constant refinishing and sealing. Interior use of brick and stone can also provide excellent thermal mass, or be used to provide radiant heat. Some stone and brick makes an ideal flooring or exterior paving material, cool in summer and possessing good thermal properties for passive solar heating. Caliche block has been produced for applications similar to stone and brick mentioned above. Caliche or earth material block has special structural and finishing characteristics.\n",
      "Rammed earth is more often considered for use in walls, although it can also be used for floors. Rammed earth and caliche block can be used for structural walls, and offer great potential as low-cost material alternatives with low embodied energy. In addition, such materials are fireproof.\n",
      "Caliche block and rammed earth can be produced on-site. It is very important to have soils tested for construction material use. Some soils, such as highly expansive or bentonite soils, are not suitable for structural use. Testing labs are available in most areas to determine material suitability for structural use and meeting codes.\n",
      "Soils for traditional adobe construction are not found in some areas, but other soils for earth building options are available. Many areas have a high percentage of soils suitable for ramming.\n",
      "(Official areas are approximately 19,610 acres in the Austin, TX area, according to the US. Department of Agriculture).\n",
      "Caliche is also abundant in many areas (covering 14% of the Austin geographic area, for instance) and is readily available locally.\n",

      "\"Jaspers' Warp\", also known as \"Crooked World\", was a Marvel UK storyline featuring primarily the character Captain Britain. It was originally published between 1981 and 1984 in Marvel Superheroes, #377–388, The Daredevils, #1–11 and The Mighty World of Marvel, volume 2, #7–13.\n",
      "The story features Alan Davis's first work with the Captain Britain character. It also features the only mainstream Marvel Universe work by Alan Moore, who took over writing of the storyline one-third of the way through the saga (Marvel Super-Heroes #387) when David Thorpe (who began the storyline) abruptly left the series. It officially designated the mainstream Marvel Universe with the label 616 and introduced many concepts regarding the Marvel Multiverse, such as the Captain Britain Corps and Saturnyne.\n",

      "=== Earth-238 ===\n",
      "The Crooked World Storyline spun directly out of the events of the Black Knight strip in Hulk Weekly. After that story (called The Otherworld Saga) Captain Britain and his companion, the elf called Jackdaw, are dispatched by Merlyn back home to Captain Britain's Earth from the Otherworld, which is in another dimension.\n",
      "During this journey through dimensions, Captain Britain's costume changes and Jackdaw gains a superhero costume, and he and Jackdaw find themselves on Earth. However, the pair found that this Earth is not quite as Captain Britain knew it.\n",
      "They have various weird encounters, including fighting a monster made out of junk and a group of insane Alice in Wonderland-themed villains called The Crazy Gang and the mysterious Saturnyne and her henchmen, the Avant Guard.\n",
      "During the course of his adventures he discovers he is on an alternate Earth called Earth-238 which is under the control of Sir Jim Jaspers, the leader of The Crazy Gang and a powerful mutant with the ability to warp and change reality.\n",
      "Captain Britain discovers that Jaspers was a British MP who had been in charge of regulating and eventually eliminating the superheroes of Earth-238. To carry out this massacre of this world's superheroes, Jaspers had created The Fury (whose name is another reference to Alice in Wonderland), an incredibly powerful creature able to destroy any super powered person with the exception of Jaspers himself.\n",
      "Jaspers had become insane, a side-effect of his reality warping powers, and altered this Earth to fit his own insane ideas, hence why Captain Britain had not recognised this world. After seeing The Fury kill Jackdaw and Saturnyne flee this Earth, Captain Britain is confronted by Jaspers and is killed by The Fury.\n",
      "Captain Britain however, is reconstructed in an improved form from virtually nothing by Merlyn and returned to his Earth, which is called Earth-616.After moving back into Braddock mansion and meeting his old enemy, Slaymaster, in a battle in the streets of London he discovers that Saturnyne has been placed on trial for her part in the Earth 238 disaster after a battle with The Special Executive.\n",
      "Returning with The Special Executive to act as a witness for Saturnyne, the Captain encounters various alternate versions of himself (later to be called the Captain Britain Corps) and sees the destruction of Earth 238 to stop the Jaspers Warp spreading from that reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Earth-616 ===\n",
      "Eventually returning home with The Special Executive and Saturnyne (who has been exiled) in tow, Captain Britain is confronted by Captain UK in Braddock Manor. Captain UK is his analogue from Earth 238 who was sent to Earth 616 during The Fury's massacre of her Earth's superheroes.\n",
      "Captain UK warns him that his world's Jim Jaspers plans to regulate his planet's heroes as his Earth 238 counterpart had. As they discuss this they are attacked by The Fury, who has managed to escape the destruction of its reality and has come to Earth-616 to complete its mission to kill every superhero.\n",
      "Captain Britain and The Special Executive (Captain UK is unable to fight as she is still scared after seeing The Fury kill her husband on Earth-238) battle The Fury and several of The Special Executive are killed but they manage to defeat The Fury for the time being. The Special Executive leave Earth to return to their own world, this leaves Captain Britain, Captain UK, Saturnyne, Betsy Braddock, her lover Tom Lennox and Alison Double (these last three are all powerful telepaths) to confront the threat of Jaspers on their own.\n",
      "Jaspers is elected British Prime Minister and his promises to outlaw super humans is carried out by S.T.R.I.K.E. Concentration camps are built to imprison and execute super humans but Captain Britain and his companions remain free but in hiding. Jaspers has also shown signs of the same powers his Earth-238 version showed and this world begins to slowly alter, warping reality darkly.\n",
      "Shortly after Jaspers election, the Vixen, one of his former allies, enters his office with two henchmen in an attempt to stop Jaspers by assassinating him. However, he quickly disposes of the two henchmen by warping their bodies horribly and then uses his reality warping ability to transform the Vixen into a real vixen, a female red fox.\n",
      "Immediately after this, Captain Britain decides to confront Jaspers (it is revealed that Merlyn had tested him on Earth-238 against a lesser version of Jaspers to prepare him for this greater menace) but he leaves his companions who are later discovered by Jaspers henchmen. Tom Lennox is killed; Betsy Braddock and Alison Double are captured, leaving Captain UK and Saturnyne to flee.\n",
      "Captain Britain battles Mad Jim Jaspers in 10 Downing Street but Jaspers proves too powerful for him. However The Fury enters the battle, beating Captain Britain before tackling Jaspers himself in a battle which distorts reality itself. During Captain Britain and the Fury's battle, Jaspers takes his time to create an Earth-616 version of the Crazy Gang out of the Earth's soil. Captain Britain would later run into the Crazy Gang on a few occasions in later comics. While it was the Earth-238 Jaspers who constructed the Fury and had programmed it so it couldn't kill him, the Fury recognised that the Jaspers it was now facing was not its creator but an alternate reality counterpart. Thus its rules did not apply to the Earth-616 Jaspers and the Fury attacked him by incinerating him, something that Jaspers was able to undo with his powers. Also observing this battle were Saturnyne and Captain UK, who had now been convinced to wear her costume by Saturnyne.\n",
      "The Fury eventually beats Jaspers by transporting him into an interuniversal void (where he couldn't use his reality warping powers since there was no reality to warp) and used Jaspers moment of surprise to fry his brain with a powerful electric shock, but is itself nearly destroyed in the process. Captain Britain takes advantage of this and attacks The Fury, nearly defeating it but The Fury still proves too powerful for him. However, recalling the death of her husband, Captain UK attacks The Fury and tears it apart in a fit of rage and anger. The Fury is defeated and wouldn't resurface until many years later, in Uncanny X-Men No. 445, where it appears to have regenerated and attacked the X-Men. Captain Britain, Captain UK and Saturnyne are then transported to Otherworld by Roma, Merlyn's daughter.\n",
      "Merlyn had died during the battle between The Fury and Jaspers and Roma had transported Captain Britain, Captain UK and Saturnyne for Merlyn's funeral. During their time at the funeral, Roma reveals that Merlyn had used Captain UK as bait to draw The Fury to Earth-616 and help defeat Jaspers. Roma shows them that Earth is returning to normal and transports Captain Britain and Captain UK (Saturnyne returns to her own world) to Darkmoor on Earth-616.\n",
      "The story ends with both Captains sharing a kiss and heading their separate ways.\n",

      "== Collected editions ==\n",

      "In 2002, the colourised version of the story was collected as a trade paperback. The trade paperback, simply titled \"Captain Britain\", omits the opening chapters of the storyline as written by writer Dave Thorpe, starting with Alan Moore's first issue on Captain Britain.\n",
      "Though Alan Moore gave his blessing over the reprinting of the arc, he later rescinded it when Marvel omitted crediting Alan Moore as co-creator for several characters introduced in the arc (most notably the Special Executives and the Fury). Later publications corrected this omission.\n",
      "Marvel has announced plans to release an Alan Moore/Alan Davis \"Omnibus\" hardcover of their respective works on Captain Britain. As such, the omnibus will feature the full and complete version of the \"Jasper's Warp\" storyline.\n",

      "Arjun Sarja was born as Srinivasa Sarja on 15 August 1964, in Madhugiri, in the erstwhile Mysore State. His father was Shakthi Prasad, a Kannada film actor, and his mother was Lakshmi, an art teacher. He had one elder brother Kishore Sarja, who directed Kannada films. He is married to Niveditha Arjun a former actress who has appeared in the 1986 Kannada film Ratha Sapthami under the stage name of Asha Rani. Kannada actor Rajesh is his father-in-law.

He is building the Hanuman temple at the outskirts of Chennai. A 35-foot statue of the Lord Anjaneya was sculpted exclusively for the temple and the statue of the Hanuman is in a sitting posture and weighs around 140 tonnes.

      "Arjun's father Shakti Prasad, a renowned actor of Kannada films, did not want his son to become an actor and turned down film offers that Arjun began to receive as a teenager. In a surprise move, film producer Rajendra Singh Babu managed to convince Arjun to begin shooting for a feature film for his production house without Shakti Prasad's express permission and consequently, his father agreed to Arjun's career choice. The film Simhada Mari Sainya (1981) featured him as a junior artiste and the director of the film gave him the stage name of Arjun, replacing his original name Ashok Babu. While he began to establish himself Kannada films, he received an offer from actor-producer A. V. M. Rajan and director Rama Narayanan to do a Tamil film Nandri. Simultaneously he was offered a Telugu film, Kodi Ramakrishna's Maa Pallelo Gopaludu in Telugu too which went on to be a big success, running for a year in three centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 1989-1999: Breakthrough ===\n",
      "His career as an actor began to take off in the mid-1980s and he sometimes worked for up to seven shifts in a day to keep up with the films he had committed to do By 1990, his films lost box office value and he was out of work in Tamil and Telugu films for almost a year. He subsequently chose to direct his feature film Sevagan (1992), a crime story which opened to mixed reviews, but became a box office success. Soon after, Shankar cast him in the lead role in his first film, Gentleman, after much persuasion. Arjun had initially rejected the film without listening to Shankar's narration but the director's persistence prompted him to feature in the film as a vigilante against corruption. The film opened to positive reviews and went on to become a trendsetter in the Tamil film industry, as well as achieving significant box office success, while Arjun went on to win the State Award for Best Actor. His change of fortune at the box office continued and Arjun began to gain ground as a bankable lead star in action films after his films including his patriotic directorial venture Jai Hind (1994) and Karnaa (1995), where he played a dual role, went on to become blockbusters. Kamal Haasan approached Arjun to play a police officer in the drama film Kurudhipunal (1995), and the actor jumped at the opportunity and agreed to do the film even without hearing the narration. Arjun won positive acclaim for his role, while the film became India's official entry for the 68th Academy Awards Best Foreign Language Film category.In the late 1990s, his action films often carried a patriotic theme, though he was still able to attract prominent producers and directors. After a series of unsuccessful action films, including his own venture Thaayin Manikodi (1998). With the film Mannavaru Chinnavaru (1999), he acted his 100th film co-starred with Sivaji Ganesan and Soundarya in lead roles. Arjun then briefly experimented in softer roles, portraying critically acclaimed characters of businessman with \"shades of grey\" in Prabhu Solomon's Kannodu Kanbathellam (1999). He teamed up again with Shankar in the political drama film Mudhalvan (1999). Portraying an ambitious TV journalist who receives the opportunity to become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for a day, Arjun offered bulk dates for filming the project to Shankar. The film subsequently won positive reviews with Arjun described as having \"acquitted himself with aplomb in the challenging role\". Arjun received the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor for his role as well as numerous other nominations.\n",
      "\n",

      "=== 2000-2009: Action films ===\n",
      "He play in the action film Sudhandhiram (2000), directed by Raj Kapoor. It is remake of Hindi film Ghulam. Later he plays a role as an energetic civil service officer in Vaanavil (2000). He then featured in Vasanth's romantic drama film Rhythm (2000), where he played a photographer, who eventually falls in love with another widower. Featuring a popular soundtrack and opening to positive reviews, Rhythm also became a commercial success, with a critic noting \"Arjun is as polished as ever\" and adding \"who would have conceived this idea that the \"Action King\" could attempt a soft-natured role of this kind\". He carried on with a lighter theme in his next directorial venture, the love story Vedham (2001), while he ventured into Telugu cinema again by appearing in Raja's Hanuman Junction and as a Hindu devotee in Sri Manjunatha (2001).\n",
      "The image of \"action king\" made him popular with town and village centre audiences, who appreciate the actor's fight and stunt scenes. He thus actively chose to specialise in action films, often collaborating with directors who specialised in them such as Sundar C, Venkatesh and Selva. In the mid 2000s, he appeared in several action films with the same premise, often portraying a police officer or a local do-gooder. He directed and featured in lead roles in both the action films Ezhumalai (2002) and Parasuram (2003), while also being involved in Maharajan's Arasatchi (2004). Some of his films, Giri (2004) and Marudhamalai, were box office successes, with several of his projects were not, including Madrasi, Vathiyar (2006) and Durai, in all of which he was the story writer. Despite not achieving any significant hit films in the 2000s, producers often considered Arjun as a \"minimum guarantee\" actor and felt his sizable fan following the four Southern States of India would help recover money even through dubbed versions. In a rare experimental film for him in the decade, he portrayed the role of the Hindu deity Hanuman in Krishna Vamsi's devotional film Sri Anjaneyam (2004) and worked on the film without receiving remuneration as a self-confessed worshipper of the deity. He was also cast for a change as a realistic police officer in Bharathiraja's critically acclaimed Bommalattam (2008), where a reviewer felt his \"showcase of the soft, subtle yet unrelenting cop was noteworthy\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 2010-2017: Various roles ===\n",
      "Since the turn of the decade, Arjun has attempted to move away from his \"action king\" image and accepted to star in films where he would play the antagonist or a supporting role, with the move drawing praise from film critics. In 2011, Arjun accepted the opportunity to play an extended guest role alongside Ajith Kumar in Venkat Prabhu's action thriller Mankatha, with critics praising his performance as a Police officer in the blockbuster. The following year he appeared in Kannada film Prasad, for which he won the Karnataka State Film Award for Best Actor. Portraying a middle-class father with a deaf and dumb son, Arjun noted it was a rewarding experience for him to break the monotony of his standard roles and attempt something different, admitting he was moved by the script. The film opened to unanimously positive reviews in March 2012 and then was selected to be screened at the Berlin Film Festival, with critics labelling Arjun's portrayal as a \"stunning performance\" and his \"career best\". Arjun collaborated with  Mani Ratnam with Kadal (2013), in which the actor portrayed a negative role of a smuggler in coastal Tamil Nadu. While the film opened to mixed reviews and became a box office failure, Arjun won rave reviews for his portrayal with Sify.com noting Arjun is \"deliciously despicable in his career's most memorable negative role\" and The Hindu labelling him as \"brilliant\". He then won acclaim for his portrayal of real-life police officer K. Vijay Kumar in the bilingual film Vana Yuddham, the biopic of notorious forest brigand Veerappan, as well as for his role of a paralysed swimming coach in Vasanth's romance film, Moondru Per Moondru Kadal.His latest directorial venture, Jai Hind 2 contained a message about the declining state of the Indian education system. The film became a box office success in Kannada, while the Tamil version did not perform well at the box office. In 2016, he acted in Kannada film, Game. It was released in Tamil as Oru Melliya Kodu. The film has some good performances. Arjun and Shaam, both Bengaluru boys but doing Tamil films, are apt for their roles. The Kannada and Tamil version was a Hit at the box office. In 2017, he marks in his 150th film Nibunan. It was simultaneously released in Kannada as Vismaya. Arjun looks stylish and suave as the fit and honest officer, and he excels in a couple of action blocks he gets. Varalaxmi and Prasanna have enough space for their roles and are as good as the protagonist's aides. 'Nibunan; is indeed worth your money and time for it retains the suspense element for a predominant part, there are a lot of interesting ideas and of course Arjun. These two versions is delivered on 28 July to positive reviews.\n",

      "=== 2018-present ===\n",
      "In 2018, he directed in the Kannada-Tamil movie Prema Baraha. The film stars Chandan Kumar and his daughter Aishwarya Arjun Prema Baraha has all the trademark elements of an Arjun Sarja film – stunts, patriotic fervor and a touch of devotion for Lord Hanuman. The movie was a success in Kannada. It was released in Tamil as Sollividava but did not have an impact in audience. He acted in Telegu Naa Peru Surya, Naa Illu India with Allu Arjun, followed by  Irumbu Thirai, a Tamil action movie co-starred with Vishal. Arjun play in the negative role.

      "Hong Sang Soo's parents owned the film production company Cinetel Soul. Hong took the entrance exam and entered the theater department at Chung-Ang University in South Korea. He then studied in the United States where he received his bachelor's degree from the California College of Arts and Crafts and his master's at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Career ==\n",
      "Hong made his directorial debut at age 35 with The Day a Pig Fell into the Well in 1996. Woman is the Future of Man (2004) was his first film to screen in competition at the Cannes Film Festival.Hong's films have also screened at the Berlin International Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival, and the Locarno Film Festival.He has received the Prix Un Certain Regard at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival for Hahaha, the Silver Leopard Award for Best Director at the 2013 Locarno International Film Festival for Our Sunhi, and the Golden Leopard at the 2015 Locarno International Film Festival for Right Now, Wrong Then. His 2020 film The Woman Who Ran won him the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Film style ==\n",
      "There are certain elements that are commonly found in Hong's films. A typical Hong film highlights a theme of domestic realism with many of the scenes set on residential streets, cafes, hotels, schools, and in the stairwells of apartment buildings. Characters in the film are seen walking around the city, drinking soju, and having sex. The main characters in his films are often movie directors or actors, and scenes typically consist of a single shot, often beginning and ending with a camera zoom. The budgets for his movies average about $100,000.Hong is often spontaneous when shooting, delivering the day's scene on the morning of the shoot and frequently changing stories while on set. He rarely prepares scripts in advance. Hong instead begins with a basic guideline and writes his scenes on the morning of the filming day, making changes throughout the day. Hong starts the filming day at 4 a.m. when he begins to write the dialogue for that day's shoot. Hong also develops close relationships with the actors over alcohol and cigarettes and sometimes shoots certain scenes while the actors are under the influence.Hong's style has been compared to Eric Rohmer's, and it has even be argued that allusions to Rohmer's films appear in some films directed by Hong.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Personal life ==\n",
      "In 2016, Hong was reported to be having an extramarital affair with actress Kim Min-hee, who appeared in his 2015 film, Right Now, Wrong Then. Hong admitted to the affair in March 2017, at the Seoul premiere of On the Beach at Night Alone. He filed a divorce suit from his wife in December 2016, but the court rejected his request in June 2019, insisting that only the injured party, Hong's wife, could initiate a legal separation.\n",

      "United Goans Democratic Party (UGDP) is one of two formerly dominant political parties in the Indian state of Goa. UGDP has its base amongst the Christian part of the population. It was founded in 1983 by Churchill Alemao.\n",
      "In Goa, the UGDP is however not related to the old United Goans Party. The name United Goans Democratic Party is a mere spin-off of the name of the United Goans Party, and their election symbol of \"two leaves\" is a spin-off of the symbol of \"two leaves\" which was designated in the plebiscite to determine whether Goa should be independent, as against the rose symbol for voting Goa as a part of Maharashtra. The present United Goans Democratic Party had absolutely no role to play in the plebiscite to decide whether Goa should be a separate entity or not, but they continue to use the Two Leaves symbol and a name similar to that of the party which played a major role in ensuring that Goa remains distinct, the erstwhile United Goans Party. UDGP is much weaker than its claimed predecessor, the United Goans Party which was the main opposition party during the 1960s.\n",
      "At the June 2007 state elections, the party took one out of 40 seats. It was allied with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), while in opposition in Goa and in the national government.\n",
      "In the Assembly elections of 2012, the United Goans Democratic Party could not win a single seat, while its lone MLA from the previous election, Mr. Mathany Saldanha, contested and won on a BJP ticket.\n",
      "The United Goans Democratic Party and its founder Churchill Alemao (now in the NCP) along with his hand-picked three other family members were defeated in the hustings, causing the worst Congress defeat since the time when Congress first ruled Goa, almost thirty years ago. The present BJP government has rejected all attempts of the UGDP of showing that they are close to the present dispensation. The lone UGDP legislator from the last assembly Mr. Mathany Saldanha however, was rewarded for finally quitting the UGDP by having been allotted a prime ministry. After his untimely death, his widow is holding the responsibility.\n",
      "The UGDP in the meanwhile, has lost its recognition as a party and has also lost its right to ownership of the \"two leaves\" symbol.\n",
      "Its original leader though, went beyond using a name similar to the UGP (United Goans Party) and a symbol similar to Goa's Opinion Poll (plebiscite to determine whether Goa should be a separate identity). In the last elections he rode on the back of the Save Goa movement, a movement by various groups to save Goa from the badly prepared Regional Plan, and formed a party on ts own. His newly formed party won two seats, Navelim for himself and Curtorim for his protege Reginaldo Lourenco, under the name \"SAVE GOA FRONT\", a clear rip off of the Save Goa Movement which was ruling the press releases  at that time.\n",
      "At the end of the day, the UGDP is a party which takes up every issue that crops up before it. Its two supreme leaders Anacleto Viegas and Radharao Gracias always take up opposite stands, with one supporting the issue and the other opposing it.\n",
      "Whichever side of the issue appears to be getting successful, gets the full UGDP backing, with the opposing leader relegating himself to a spectator.\n",
      "The said two party supremos, Anacleto Viegas and Radharao Gracias are also senior advocates at Margao and South Goa. Both have been presidents of the Margao and South Goa Advocates Councils. Such appointments have led them to lead their own political campaigns under the banner of the Advocates' Union.\n",

The honeycomb shape is able to support heavy equipment by redirecting downward energy outward, “decreasing differential settlement of soft subgrades,” providing soil confinement, stabilization, and reinforcement. The resulting surface is functional in very cold (-60C) to very hot (60C) conditions.The product is notable for its durability, and reduced cost and carbon footprint, resulting from the use of local, rather than imported, aggregate materials.In addition to temporary roadway applications, it has also been approved for municipal road construction projects.\n",

      "== Career ==\n",
      "Lahoud attended the University of New Haven, where he played college baseball for the New Haven Chargers.Lahoud played for the Winston-Salem Red Sox of the Class A Carolina League in 1966 and 1967. Though optioned to the minor leagues during spring training in 1968, the Red Sox recalled Lahoud from the Louisville Colonels of the Class AAA International League at the start of the 1968 season as Tony Conigliaro struggled with his recovery from an eye injury. He was soon sent to Louisville to continue his development. The Red Sox optioned Lahoud to Louisville at the end of spring training in 1970.On October 10, 1971, the Red Sox traded Lahoud to the Milwaukee Brewers with Ken Brett, Billy Conigliaro, Jim Lonborg, Don Pavletich, and George Scott for Tommy Harper, Lew Krausse, Marty Pattin, and minor leaguer Pat Skrable. On October 22, 1973, the Brewers traded Lahoud to the California Angels with Ollie Brown, Skip Lockwood, Ellie Rodriguez, and Gary Ryerson for Steve Barber, Ken Berry, Art Kusnyer, Clyde Wright, and cash. On June 14, 1976, the Texas Rangers acquired Lahoud from the Angels for \"slightly more than the waiver price\".In his career, Lahoud played in 791 games and had a .223 batting average with 65 home runs, 218 runs batted in, 429 hits, 239 runs scored, and a .372 slugging percentage.

      "Earth materials include minerals, rocks, soil and water. These are the naturally occurring materials found on Earth that constitute the raw materials upon which our global society exists. Earth materials are vital resources that provide the basic components for life, agriculture and industry. Earth materials can also include metals and precious rocks.\n",

      "== Definitions ==\n",
      "The type of materials available locally will of course vary depending upon the conditions in the area of the building site. Take considerations of what is explained below.\n",
      "In many areas, indigenous stone is available from the local region, such as limestone, marble, granite, and sandstone. It may be cut in quarries or removed from the surface of the ground (flag and fieldstone). Ideally, stone from the building site can be utilized. Depending on the stone type, it can be used for structural block, facing block, pavers, and crushed stone.\n",
      "Most brick plants are located near the clay source they use to make brick. Bricks are molded and baked blocks of clay. Brick products come in many forms, including structural brick, face brick, roof tile, structural tile, paving brick, and floor tile.\n",
      "Caliche is a soft limestone material which is mined from areas with calcium-carbonate soils and limestone bedrock. It is best known as a road bed material, but it can be processed into an unfired building block, stabilized with an additive such as cement. Other earth materials include soil blocks typically stabilized with a cement additive and produced with forms or compression.\n",
      "Rammed Earth consists of walls made from moist, sandy soil, or stabilized soil, which is tamped into form work. Walls are a minimum of 12″ thick. Soils should contain about 30% clay and 70% sand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Considerations ==\n",
      "The use of locally available and indigenous earth materials has several advantages in terms of sustainability. They are:\n",
      "Reduction of energy costs related to transportation.\n",
      "Reduction of material costs due to reduced transportation costs, especially for well-established industries.\n",
      "Support of local businesses and resource bases.\n",
      "Care must be taken to ensure that non-renewable earth materials are not over-extracted. Ecological balance within the region needs to be maintained while efficiently utilizing its resources. Many local suppliers carry materials that have been shipped in from out of the area, so it is important to ask for locally produced/quarried materials.\n",
      "Both brick and stone materials are aesthetically pleasing, durable, and low maintenance. Exterior walls weather well, eliminating the need for constant refinishing and sealing. Interior use of brick and stone can also provide excellent thermal mass, or be used to provide radiant heat. Some stone and brick makes an ideal flooring or exterior paving material, cool in summer and possessing good thermal properties for passive solar heating. Caliche block has been produced for applications similar to stone and brick mentioned above. Caliche or earth material block has special structural and finishing characteristics.\n",
      "Rammed earth is more often considered for use in walls, although it can also be used for floors. Rammed earth and caliche block can be used for structural walls, and offer great potential as low-cost material alternatives with low embodied energy. In addition, such materials are fireproof.\n",
      "Caliche block and rammed earth can be produced on-site. It is very important to have soils tested for construction material use. Some soils, such as highly expansive or bentonite soils, are not suitable for structural use. Testing labs are available in most areas to determine material suitability for structural use and meeting codes.\n",
      "Soils for traditional adobe construction are not found in some areas, but other soils for earth building options are available. Many areas have a high percentage of soils suitable for ramming.\n",
      "(Official areas are approximately 19,610 acres in the Austin, TX area, according to the US. Department of Agriculture).\n",
      "Caliche is also abundant in many areas (covering 14% of the Austin geographic area, for instance) and is readily available locally.\n",

      "\"Jaspers' Warp\", also known as \"Crooked World\", was a Marvel UK storyline featuring primarily the character Captain Britain. It was originally published between 1981 and 1984 in Marvel Superheroes, #377–388, The Daredevils, #1–11 and The Mighty World of Marvel, volume 2, #7–13.\n",
      "The story features Alan Davis's first work with the Captain Britain character. It also features the only mainstream Marvel Universe work by Alan Moore, who took over writing of the storyline one-third of the way through the saga (Marvel Super-Heroes #387) when David Thorpe (who began the storyline) abruptly left the series. It officially designated the mainstream Marvel Universe with the label 616 and introduced many concepts regarding the Marvel Multiverse, such as the Captain Britain Corps and Saturnyne.\n",

      "=== Earth-238 ===\n",
      "The Crooked World Storyline spun directly out of the events of the Black Knight strip in Hulk Weekly. After that story (called The Otherworld Saga) Captain Britain and his companion, the elf called Jackdaw, are dispatched by Merlyn back home to Captain Britain's Earth from the Otherworld, which is in another dimension.\n",
      "During this journey through dimensions, Captain Britain's costume changes and Jackdaw gains a superhero costume, and he and Jackdaw find themselves on Earth. However, the pair found that this Earth is not quite as Captain Britain knew it.\n",
      "They have various weird encounters, including fighting a monster made out of junk and a group of insane Alice in Wonderland-themed villains called The Crazy Gang and the mysterious Saturnyne and her henchmen, the Avant Guard.\n",
      "During the course of his adventures he discovers he is on an alternate Earth called Earth-238 which is under the control of Sir Jim Jaspers, the leader of The Crazy Gang and a powerful mutant with the ability to warp and change reality.\n",
      "Captain Britain discovers that Jaspers was a British MP who had been in charge of regulating and eventually eliminating the superheroes of Earth-238. To carry out this massacre of this world's superheroes, Jaspers had created The Fury (whose name is another reference to Alice in Wonderland), an incredibly powerful creature able to destroy any super powered person with the exception of Jaspers himself.\n",
      "Jaspers had become insane, a side-effect of his reality warping powers, and altered this Earth to fit his own insane ideas, hence why Captain Britain had not recognised this world. After seeing The Fury kill Jackdaw and Saturnyne flee this Earth, Captain Britain is confronted by Jaspers and is killed by The Fury.\n",
      "Captain Britain however, is reconstructed in an improved form from virtually nothing by Merlyn and returned to his Earth, which is called Earth-616.After moving back into Braddock mansion and meeting his old enemy, Slaymaster, in a battle in the streets of London he discovers that Saturnyne has been placed on trial for her part in the Earth 238 disaster after a battle with The Special Executive.\n",
      "Returning with The Special Executive to act as a witness for Saturnyne, the Captain encounters various alternate versions of himself (later to be called the Captain Britain Corps) and sees the destruction of Earth 238 to stop the Jaspers Warp spreading from that reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Earth-616 ===\n",
      "Eventually returning home with The Special Executive and Saturnyne (who has been exiled) in tow, Captain Britain is confronted by Captain UK in Braddock Manor. Captain UK is his analogue from Earth 238 who was sent to Earth 616 during The Fury's massacre of her Earth's superheroes.\n",
      "Captain UK warns him that his world's Jim Jaspers plans to regulate his planet's heroes as his Earth 238 counterpart had. As they discuss this they are attacked by The Fury, who has managed to escape the destruction of its reality and has come to Earth-616 to complete its mission to kill every superhero.\n",
      "Captain Britain and The Special Executive (Captain UK is unable to fight as she is still scared after seeing The Fury kill her husband on Earth-238) battle The Fury and several of The Special Executive are killed but they manage to defeat The Fury for the time being. The Special Executive leave Earth to return to their own world, this leaves Captain Britain, Captain UK, Saturnyne, Betsy Braddock, her lover Tom Lennox and Alison Double (these last three are all powerful telepaths) to confront the threat of Jaspers on their own.\n",
      "Jaspers is elected British Prime Minister and his promises to outlaw super humans is carried out by S.T.R.I.K.E. Concentration camps are built to imprison and execute super humans but Captain Britain and his companions remain free but in hiding. Jaspers has also shown signs of the same powers his Earth-238 version showed and this world begins to slowly alter, warping reality darkly.\n",
      "Shortly after Jaspers election, the Vixen, one of his former allies, enters his office with two henchmen in an attempt to stop Jaspers by assassinating him. However, he quickly disposes of the two henchmen by warping their bodies horribly and then uses his reality warping ability to transform the Vixen into a real vixen, a female red fox.\n",
      "Immediately after this, Captain Britain decides to confront Jaspers (it is revealed that Merlyn had tested him on Earth-238 against a lesser version of Jaspers to prepare him for this greater menace) but he leaves his companions who are later discovered by Jaspers henchmen. Tom Lennox is killed; Betsy Braddock and Alison Double are captured, leaving Captain UK and Saturnyne to flee.\n",
      "Captain Britain battles Mad Jim Jaspers in 10 Downing Street but Jaspers proves too powerful for him. However The Fury enters the battle, beating Captain Britain before tackling Jaspers himself in a battle which distorts reality itself. During Captain Britain and the Fury's battle, Jaspers takes his time to create an Earth-616 version of the Crazy Gang out of the Earth's soil. Captain Britain would later run into the Crazy Gang on a few occasions in later comics. While it was the Earth-238 Jaspers who constructed the Fury and had programmed it so it couldn't kill him, the Fury recognised that the Jaspers it was now facing was not its creator but an alternate reality counterpart. Thus its rules did not apply to the Earth-616 Jaspers and the Fury attacked him by incinerating him, something that Jaspers was able to undo with his powers. Also observing this battle were Saturnyne and Captain UK, who had now been convinced to wear her costume by Saturnyne.\n",
      "The Fury eventually beats Jaspers by transporting him into an interuniversal void (where he couldn't use his reality warping powers since there was no reality to warp) and used Jaspers moment of surprise to fry his brain with a powerful electric shock, but is itself nearly destroyed in the process. Captain Britain takes advantage of this and attacks The Fury, nearly defeating it but The Fury still proves too powerful for him. However, recalling the death of her husband, Captain UK attacks The Fury and tears it apart in a fit of rage and anger. The Fury is defeated and wouldn't resurface until many years later, in Uncanny X-Men No. 445, where it appears to have regenerated and attacked the X-Men. Captain Britain, Captain UK and Saturnyne are then transported to Otherworld by Roma, Merlyn's daughter.\n",
      "Merlyn had died during the battle between The Fury and Jaspers and Roma had transported Captain Britain, Captain UK and Saturnyne for Merlyn's funeral. During their time at the funeral, Roma reveals that Merlyn had used Captain UK as bait to draw The Fury to Earth-616 and help defeat Jaspers. Roma shows them that Earth is returning to normal and transports Captain Britain and Captain UK (Saturnyne returns to her own world) to Darkmoor on Earth-616.\n",

      "== Collected editions ==\n",

      "In 2002, the colourised version of the story was collected as a trade paperback. The trade paperback, simply titled \"Captain Britain\", omits the opening chapters of the storyline as written by writer Dave Thorpe, starting with Alan Moore's first issue on Captain Britain.\n",
      "Though Alan Moore gave his blessing over the reprinting of the arc, he later rescinded it when Marvel omitted crediting Alan Moore as co-creator for several characters introduced in the arc (most notably the Special Executives and the Fury). Later publications corrected this omission.\n",
      "Marvel has announced plans to release an Alan Moore/Alan Davis \"Omnibus\" hardcover of their respective works on Captain Britain. As such, the omnibus will feature the full and complete version of the \"Jasper's Warp\" storyline.\n",

      "Garden of Prayer is a 1954 album of songs recorded by American singer Jo Stafford, accompanied by the orchestra of Paul Weston. Each of the eight tracks on this album has a religious or inspirational theme. It was released in 1954 by Columbia Records (CL 6286), then reissued on CD in 2010 by Sinetone AMR, and appears under two titles - either Garden of Prayer or Beautiful Garden of Prayer.\n",
      "A contemporary reviewer writing for Billboard was quite impressed. They praised Stafford for being able to \"sing almost any type of tune\" and for doing \"a first-rate job here\". Stafford sings these \"sacred songs....with deep conviction and sincerity\", and the reviewer notes that the album should be quite popular in the Bible Belt of the United States.\n",

He enlists Tarzan, and a fabulous airship is constructed to penetrate Pellucidar via the natural polar opening connecting the outer and inner worlds. The airship is crewed primarily by Germans, with Tarzan's Waziri warriors under their chief Muviro also along for the expedition.\n",
